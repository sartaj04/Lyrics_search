I feel it in my bones I feel it in my bones I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house Such a modest mouse I can't do it alone I can't do it alone  Every time I see you in the world You always step to my girl  Ancestors told me that their girl was better She's richer than Croesus, she's tougher than leather I just ignore all the tales of her past life Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife And punks who would laugh when they saw us together Well, they didn't know how to dress for the weather I can still see them there, huddled on Astor Snow falling slow to the sound of the master  The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out What you on about?

In the shadow of your first attack I was questioning and looking back You said, ""Baby, we don't speak of that"" Like a real aristocrat Compound to compound, lazy and safe Wanted to leave it, wanted to wait When the taxi door was open wide I pretended I was horrified By the uniform and gloves outside Of the courtyard gate You're not a victim, but neither am I Nostalgic for garbage, desperate for time I could blame it on your mother's hair Or the colors that your father wears But I know that I was never fair You were always fine  Unsentimental, traveling around Sure of myself, sure of it now You were standing there so close to me Like the future was supposed to be In the aisles of the grocery And the blocks uptown I remember, remember it well And if I'd forgotten, could you tell? In the shadow of your first attack I was questioning and looking back You were standing on another track Like a real aristocratYou might also like5Embed"
