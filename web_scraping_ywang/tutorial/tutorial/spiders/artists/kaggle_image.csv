Fly In,rap,Lil Wayne,2005,78271,{},"[Intro]
So they ask me
""Young boy
What you gon' do the second time around?
How you gon' come back?""
I tried told 'em
""I come back like 32
I jump back like 33""
Ugh, hit me
That's nothing
This is Tha Carter II, people
This is Tha Carter II, people
Hey

[Verse]
They call me Mr. Carter, I kissed the daughter
Of the dead's forehead, I killed the father
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater
I will put them body on chill like glaciers, gracias
I'm crazy, yes, it's obvious
Going against me is atheist
I got my angels on my shoulder and a quarter of that angel dust
I ain't sniffing, I'm just pitching, your honor
I ain't snitching, your honor
Hate bitch niggas, bitches with power
Vacate when that kitchen get hotter
I just sit on the counter
Open the cabinet, close the cupboard
Put that jar in the skillet, drop a four in the bubbles
I remember being young, tryna hustle my dope
Tryna tell the old junkies that my crack ain't soap
Tryna tell you 'fore you jump that my MAC ain't broke
You ain't tryna see how far that black back lane go, no
Call me Pac-Man, your ghost is blue
I got my Red River rubies and my ocean blue jewelry
Usually I'm a hooligan for the money
Yeah, I'm eating, but I got a tapeworm in my tummy, oh
Make harm and I bomb you in public
Hit you with the straight-arm, no warning, nothing
Look, it's morning, no yawning or nothing
I ain't sleeping, I'm up tryna take a nigga lunch
You gon' make a nigga break a nigga fronts
Then shake a nigga shorts and we taking what we want
I'm so 504, you got to kill me here
If you ever looking for me, bitch, I will be here
Cash Money is an army, Navy Seal me here
Lot of niggas ran from me, but I still be here
No chrome on the Continental, I'm so fundamental
Crack the Phil', crack the roof, and roll up the windows
And my hood love me, they tell me bring it home
That's why I holler Hollygrove on each and every song
You leaping at a dog, a dog with no bark
Just a bite like an old shark
And all you rich niggas know Pa, I'm talking 'bout Stunna
He like, ""Keep your dough,"" he got your ho
And the sun shines on the king and sets on the prince
I met the Birdman and I been shining ever since, like that",6,https://images.genius.com/98c56aa11e01a9c25b7485cc3a25c78f.300x300x1.jpg
Foo Dang,rap,Anybody Killa,2002,281,"{""Blaze Ya Dead Homie""}","[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Why you tryin to play me, foo dang? (Foo Dang)
Just cause I wanna let my nuts hang
Teeth bang on the streets servin heads all night
Some of us just ain't livin right

[Blaze]
I know this stupid bitch who think she know me
She even wanna call me Blaze Her Dead Homie
Bitch keep ya mouth shut cause ya foo dang
Couldn't hold my balls, couldn't hold my wang
Stank hoes wanna see me in the grave
But I'm quick to slap a trick wit a 12 gauge
You know you was speakin my name, playin games
And sayin things you know he's actin like something changed
But I know you are reppin your fancy car
Little money, foo dangin at the tittie bar (Bitch!)
7 dicks shoved in her box nightly, is she fucking?
(Is she fuckin?) For the right price she might me
Stank hoe, I never paid for ass
So take a stray cat, and shove it in ya flat ass
Get up out my face wit that foo dang drama
Where she learn that shit? Man she get it from her mama
[Some guy]
I say Foo, you say Dang
Foo (Fuck You!!)
Dang (Fuck You!!)
Someone say fa sho, yea I'm in the house
Yea I'm in the house

[Chorus]

[Anybody Killa]
I foo dang on the daily, go ahead and call me shady
Bad boy on the streets, startin static since the '80s
So why you gotta front? Try and play me like a punk
If you keep talkin shit, you gon' end up in my trunk
Jackin beats from bustas, we foo dang like that
Robbin hoes for they gold then trade it in for a sack
Don't even think for a second that we high class
40 drinkin freaks with some dank and a nice ass
? identity with some eastside conflict
Bitches make me sick if they don't foo dang dick
Keep it real and I'll try to keep it real back
Try to trip in over all the bodies that I shot wit the gat
Hunt you down wit my automobile, roll down the window slow
Then punch you right in the throat
Type of shit that most people call a little fucked
But it's simple and plain, we foo dang, so don't front
[Some guy]
Yo Killa, this Tadpole
I got ya number from this bitch I know
I was the guy followin you home from the signin ??
Yo man why you ain't pull over?
I ain't no houndog or nothin but I just

[Chorus]

[Blaze]
Foo dang is what I call a hoe without a pistol
Walkin all alone (There she go) and if I see you it's on
I'm callin out old janky bitches wit no heart
Dogs with no bite that wanna bark
Reppin gold is like a crip wearin red in my hood
And I'll slap ya wit a bat like a G should (Beeitch!!)
Bitch, check yourself into the crackhead clinic
You can't get no ? bringin a bag wit bottles in it

[Anybody Killa]
Foo dangin wit a hatchet, come and get ya ass kicked
If you bring a bottle then I really wanna smash it
Sellin weed filled wit stems and seeds
Same shit for $550 but you askin a G
Now that's the kinda shit that makes a mind go crazy
2 packs of 'Ports a day and I just can't take it
I swear if 1 more hero tries to flex in my face
I'll go foo dang around the globe and make the whole world change

Sunshine,rap,AZ,2004,655,{},"Once again, firm affiliation
Like we say; the show must go on

[Chorus: 2X]
Sunshine - we hustle to the moon light
Reminisce on a good time
Cop come on boget

Yo when times get trifle
I'm subjected to street survival
See many never complete they cycle
Other retreat to bibles, living holy
But currency seem to control me, moving coldly
In the presence of old parolies
My mind mold me, keep me in mack mode like Goldie
Police know me, but ain't got enough to hold me
I follow rules, through the knowledge, swallow jewels
A form of teaching, from the streets never taught in school
You caught you lose, a wise man utilize tools
Solitude certifies all moves
So I walk this path of the old dread, that lead me off the Ave
Absorbing fast, learning from niggas I lost in the past
Its poison plays in these foul days
Housing cops and they foul ways, I'm walking through a wild maze
Holding my brain trying to maintain
Sleet hell, snow, or rain, I guess the game will never change
[Chorus]

Since the genesis, paraphernalia circle my premises
Poor images, project life drained my innocence
It's all the worst genocide, I guess the water's cursed
My old earth identify, though her soul is for the church
She prayed for peace, hoping I'm saved before she lay deceased
To say the least, the one to wise to play the streets
I know the ropes, certain niggas to slow to cope
& though I sold some Coke, it was only to stay afloat
Amongst the frozen hearted, some bending, some departed
Inhaling chocolate, tracing back to where it started
The Crack wave 2 for 5, deuce and trays
The Mack sprays, puffin' lye, truth & days
& though it sound ill, through all the foul shit, I'm down still
All around real, rough is the grounds in Brownsville
I know the ledge, meditating, holding my head
Eyes red, it's ""Doe or Die"" till I'm dead

[Chorus]

I played all positions, plus learned from each mission
Politic wit all type niggas wit different diction
I did it up, from young in some cunt, the way I hit it up
Bugging off my first Philly Blunt, and how I lit it up
But time flying, playing these corners I'll let it slide by
Smoking lye, homicide, coke supplies dry
So play the game, other slow up change the lane
Awaken, unchain the brain in exchange to take away the pain
It's a part of scriptures, put together wit different mixtures
They tricked us, got us trapped in taking pictures
Interrogating, locating, destination, estimating
Or play a part of them investigating
It's on going from them killers, to them broads hoeing
Unknowing first time felons on trial blowing
So burn your clips and sit back, learn your shit
The last of these real reps left turned legit
[Chorus]",8716,https://images.genius.com/fb708d94440fffe20eb3e9b4d6487268.297x297x1.jpg
Time,rap,AZ,2004,7577,"{Nas,Nature}","[Verse 1: Nature]
At the ripe age of 24, I done seen it all, done it all
Some dreams stay fresh and some are spoiled
Dealin' with time, winter, spring, summer, fall
It's crazy changes, is this that made me famous?
I come a long way from Timbs, minimum wages
Stockin' caps, summer jobs, pockets flat
It's funny how my childhood idols now be coppin' crack
I ain't knockin' that, unfortunately, life's too short to see
It's only right we move accordingly at every second
I use to carry heavy weapons
Previously cocked, tucked in my shirt for every session
But hold up, a 2-6 bid made me grow up
Came home to the same damn dreams with no luck
And half the clique's strong, the other half moved on
Some with new lives and new wives, niggas live long
The foulest thing about time - it still ticks when you gone

[Verse 2: Nas]
For those who live the way I live, we came a long way
From wipin' cold outta eyelids to rap's hottest
Smokin' lye, let track guide us
Remember back then before MAC-10's, expensive bottles?
Had a sick mind, niggas taught me how to get mine
We'd often sip quarts, they get tossed at the spit line
To all niggas that the Lord seemed to gip for their time
While we plan to live forev', he had a different design
Is it safe to say, we all perish on the sacred day?
With my luck, soon as I reach the gate, they make me pay
Pray, minutes go by, Indigo high
The specialist, decked out dark specs, finessin' it
Used to play catch-a-kiss, same girls back then
Now, leave us messages, a whole lot
Travel to my old spot where we sold rock, although it's trifle
Ain't nothin' changed, just like time, it's all a cycle
[Verse 3: AZ]
Yo, wake up to the world, stay in charge of your dreams
Keep your vision, focus, get wise, enlargen your cream
Marketin' schemes, so many in the dark is unseen
Caught in between, perhaps rap was a fortunate thing
Forced to be king from hustlin', supportin' them fiends
Bustin' guns, I had no remorse as a teen
Rockin' birth stones, my first skid bid, nurse the dome
It hurts to zone, now I've realized, I'm on this Earth alone
Time ticks, devilish mind design tricks
Leave you blind quick and cause you to die behind shit
Mathematics, master 120, I'm Asiatic
Amazed with magic 'cause it's illusions that made me savage
Life change once you establish the right game
Love the night rain, found a new way to fight pain
Clocks never stop, it's all a race to the top
Tryin' to freeze time, that's why I iced the face of my watch",8717,https://images.genius.com/fb708d94440fffe20eb3e9b4d6487268.297x297x1.jpg

See these broads, I like 'em and shit
Wish I could give all these hoes a picture-of-my dick
See I like em and psyche em, then I get in the win
I might just need you and leave you at a quarter past ten, but
I ain't gonna lie, your pussy was good
But your mouth is better so I wish you would
Work your way down to the diznick
It feels so good when you do the liznick
You got me doing push-ups and I'm taking ginseng
(Let's get ready to rumble!) In the middle of the ring
You got my dick hard like a '57 Chevy
Rocked up, ya cocked up, cause I'm ready
To go up in ya, let that other nigga send ya
Cards and shit while you suckin' my dick
I like you a little bit more than I'm diggin' my shirt
Ya little pretty ass dick suckin' expert, beeyoch!

See I love these broads but I toss em up quick
Every trick that I get, they get flipped through the clique

These broads, nigga, I wish that I could love 'em all
These broads, nigga, I wish that I could fuck 'em all
These broads, I let these hoes just drive my car
But these hoes know one thing: that I'm a superstar
These hoes get out of line, I'ma show 'em I'm a hog
And now that I'm rich, I show these hoes that they ain't shit
And every ho I fuck with, I make suck my dick
It ain't no secret, I know these hoes about my money, shit
But I tell a ho quick, that she ain't shit
My main ho Clare, I don't make her suck my dick
I might just get loose and wanna kiss my bitch
But now that I got a daughter, I'm supposed to be light on a bitch
But I'm gonna be hard on these hoes for life, shit
I'm a true U-P-T player for life, shit
But I'ma say it again, I don't love no bitches

Now I done been here for 25 years
I understand one thing: that life is a bitch
I done lost my ma and my pa, my brother and my sister all up in one year
I understand one thing, I gotta ball 'til I fall
And show these hoes that money ain't no thang, dawg
See, I tell a bitch that she ain't shit
And at the same time ask that ho to suck my dick
See, I don't take money and mix with no bitch
Cause one thing, these hoes would lose they mind and get lost quick
It ain't no secret, I make these hoes think I'll pay their shit
But I keep it real and I pay my nigga's shit

Range Rover, Rolls Royce, even got a Rocky Rolly
See more ice than a hockey goalie
Baby eating guacamole

Now I live it out
Cars? got to whip it out
Every year I get it out
(Why?) I be long gone
(Where?) probably Hong Kong
Girls with their thong on
I'm playing Don Juan
Drinking Chandon
Where the chron, ma?
""You smoke weed?"" ""What you think, girl? Uh-huh!""
Start the car up
Take her on a long ride
Yo she think my steering wheel on the wrong side

Limon like Bacardi
Rock with safari

And every night, believe, we gon' leave with somebody

We was rockin' and rollin'
Now we rollin' and smokin'

No-no for homos
F doing promos
I was Def already I just added the So-So
Wherever we at
Ready to act
Better be strapped
I live the life of Riley
Whether Teddy or Pat
And when it come to the cash
Bet I'm heavy with that
If your man want to bet
Then I bet he be cracked
And your little girlfriend
She was wet off the bat
From the Chevy tonight;
Yo, I'll bet she be back
For the one night stand
Yeah, the sex in the sack
Yo I ask her if she miss it
Then I tell her to kiss it
Come on

Ay yo your girl around me? That's like sand to a beach
Or a gram to a ki or a branch to a tree
Your money? That's my advance to a G

Yeah acting wild
Jimmy back me, child
How long you think an ounce gonna last me now?
But I love when hoes call me
""The Cat's Meow""
Cause I run up in them and I make their cats meow
Are you hip to the jive?
How we get to the thighs?
Half of my game? Yo, that shit be a lie
But it's true about Duke from the hoop to the 5
And I'm right behind him in a coupe that we drive
Baby am I slick

Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow

With my muscle you'll be dazzled, but hustlin's a hassle
Percocet, Demerol, capsules of Paxil
Cops wanna cuff you, niggas wanna clap you
Bitches might burn you; they runnin' with that clap too
But the monster made it
Do it for those incarcerated, who had it confiscated
Hate it when they take powder
Upstate he take showers
Baby moms on Greyhound for 8 hours
See her man face-to-face through the glass
On the phone. 10 years he got, chasin' that cash
Cocaine, he had that game in a smash
Felt like the Towers when the planes went on crash
It wasn't 9-11, but it was 9-1-1
Gave him 9 plus 1, dropped a dime on dun
I told him get his 9 and run
Turned himself in, I had to find that dumb

Always a snitch in the game, what you want: prison or fame?
Either one, dun, long as my digits the same
He lookin' frigid, dig it, make sure them digits get changed
'Cause I can't be in Hell's cell, shout out to Mel Mel
Cash and Hell Rell, Zeek doin' 3, he even fell, hell
He comin' home on '07 and 12 cells

Blaze 'em when they cross sharks

Can't see his son shine like the Four Tops
My antennas will block the scanners

Lawyers to watch lawyers, cameras to watch cameras
Niggas to watch bitches, Nana to watch Grandma

It's been a long time riding and a long time running, man
Shit done changed since The Wop and The Running Man
Since Nino, Gee Money, The Carter, and the Duh-Duh Man
It's no longer a New Jack City
It's ""cop fast and move that quickly"" or cops crash
Spent a long time coming up this road
And I ain't talking rap, man, I'm coming up this road
I'm talking crack, man and coming up with O's
I'm coming up with halves and coming up with wholes
Shit got hectic had to come up with my hoes
They would boof it and go, I receive it move it and roll
I was comin' from the Q, Zeek was comin' from the O
Jim chose to give his work to smash in dough
We was all on the paper-run
Yeah, waiting for a change to come
Now look: the change has come
The 7-Pick Up, Yukon, the Range is come

You look hard, but on the inside you softer than a silicon titty

You can look at the kid and see just how them Chinchillas gonna fit me
I strut through like I conceal a chrome with me
Pockets bulgin like I got some millions with me
Any bitch that chill or jones with me
End up butt ass naked inside a Villa home with me

Personally I think they was reachin' a little though
But now they callin' just to get a feature so it'll blow

To stay on the grind and away from the leeches and little hoes

It's  Kid Capri and Jay-Z, come on!
It's Jay-Z and Kid Capri, don't stop, huh-huh!
'Cause I'm like that y'all, yeah
I'm really like that

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
As a young'un, dumb and gun in the waist
Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain
And had to numb it with base
Couldn't drink the Henny straight, I needed somethin to chase
Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin' nothin' to waste
Life's like a treadmill, niggas runnin' in place
Gettin' nowhere fast, a whole year done past
I vowed to never stop winnin', 'til the earth stop spinnin'
Rock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin'
My motto is, simply ""I will not lose!""
Abide by the block rules, I buy my Glocks used
With bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
I'm raised, irrational, ways misunderstood
If you ain't live like I live, then one with the hood
I done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature
If hell awaits a, nigga I'm comin' with the razors
Still flashin' ya shit, try to pass me in a six
Type classy on the wrist, every bit of 30 karats
This is, not a game this is not why I came
May these words find a spot on your brain and burn
Then I recycle my life, I shall return

I'm a hop skip and a jump from grippin' the pump
Spittin' a couple of curse words, and hittin' you chump
Shit, I get digits in lumps
I'm a motherfuckin' problem, is this what you want?
Overachiever, I love chicks that puff cheeba in reefer paper
I hate the ones that blow up ya beeper
'Cause I, go in deeper, I only bone divas
Impregnate the world when I come through your speakers (ha ha!)
Fuck hot, my records got the fever
Niggas kick dirt, get ya whole block sweeped up
I creep up when the beef heats up
Caught him with his feet up and shoes off, 'bout to snooze off
Hatin', 'cause you can't turn the booze off
You dudes is too soft, why I don't fuck with you all
I might bark at X, or spit at The LOX
But, other than that, I don't be fuckin' with cats
Just me, Ty and B-High, thug it like that
E, Dame and Biggs, what's fuckin' with that?
Y'all can never diss Jigga, get nothin' for that
Other than a couple of slugs in ya back (ha ha)
Rappers y'all, runnin' around like I won't gun ya down

The Liberation of Lonzo Williams,rap,The Coup,1993,851,{},"[Verse 1 - Boots Riley (and E-Roc)]
1986 a motherfucker doing tricks in the mix and I don't mean the fader
Face of zits but getting grits with black steel firesticks
Trying to build an Empire something like Darth Vader
Now Lonzo was armed with nothing but a mean mug
(But tucked a forty-five, with forty-five slugs)
He was a jitterbug thug, at the dance, cuttin a rug
(Treatin his sisters like a hooker) Greetin his partners with a hug
Breakdown shakedown, this brother would take pounds
Of soon to be cake grounds, and then go make rounds
Firearms protected wads of gorgeous green
Paper stacks of paid tax off of broken dreams
At puberty his liberty was found within a ki
Rocks were cookin but he's lookin for a way to be free
Here's a ki (there's a ki) but Lonzo, where's yours?
There's no key to the door, but there's money on the floor
(So stoop down) bend over (hurry pick it up fast)
But watch out, Lonzo -- YOU'LL GET FUCKED IN THE ASS

[HOOK]
[Verse 2 - Boots Riley (and E-roc)]
Knock knock (who is it?) time to visit but it's two years late
Cause Lonzo's rollin harder and it's 1988
He's got some fat ends, got some more friends, (and a brand new Benz)
He's got respect and he suspects that it won't end
A couch is still a couch (and a chair is still a chair)
But a house is now a crackhouse, Luther, Lonzo's there
Dying brains, dying bodies, taken from these dead residence
Trying in vain to kill their pain, exchanging dead presidents
Many bourgeoise parlez francoise (I don't speak it but I know it)
It's all the same (the business game) but you go to jail for this shit
We were tribal our survival was now based on stoppin rivals
Who's the fittest, as I raise my fists, I can't survive and not be ruthless
(So while we scrape, and scratch for bones
And a cellular phone, somebody's sittin on the throne
Cause they don't let, black folks own)
THEY JUST GIVE US THIS SHIT ON LOAN, KICK IT

[HOOK]

(Ahaha, yeah, what was I fidna say?
Aww yeah Lonzo's back in the County, man)
Damn we'll go visit him on Sunday when we visit Dee, aight?

[Verse 3 - Boots Riley (and E-roc)]
(Madge says that Bounty is the quicker-picker-upper)
Well Lonzo says the County is the slip-up, trip-up, stuck-up
Years of unsettled funk and who gets what bunk junk
Makes you feel like you took a test and flunked
(But don't get disturbed or perturbed; the teacher's
On my last nerve, plus he grades with a downhill curve)
Told Lonzo kick it, the system is wicked, trick it, but dig it
We got a way to lick it, gave him a book, said, ""Here's the ticket""
(Now he's addicted) to learnin how we been afflicted
And what distributin that shit did
I made a quick bid to say, ""Don't trip kid
You never worked for the mob"" (You had a government job)
Lonzo knew I was right, no fight, now we're tight
(Plus he been out of jail about a year ago last night)
Now he hangs with us for revolutionary ruckus
And five-oh, more than ever wants to fuck us
Just cause we know the road to riches is crooked and narrow
We'll get more power from a hundred thousand gun barrels",646,https://images.genius.com/4722f605d3ccc60aaa54b435b0663a59.436x425x1.jpg

Why you tryin to play me, foo dang? (Foo Dang)
Just cause I wanna let my nuts hang
Teeth bang on the streets servin heads all night
Some of us just ain't livin right

[Blaze]
I know this stupid bitch who think she know me
She even wanna call me Blaze Her Dead Homie
Bitch keep ya mouth shut cause ya foo dang
Couldn't hold my balls, couldn't hold my wang
Stank hoes wanna see me in the grave
But I'm quick to slap a trick wit a 12 gauge
You know you was speakin my name, playin games
And sayin things you know he's actin like something changed
But I know you are reppin your fancy car
Little money, foo dangin at the tittie bar (Bitch!)
7 dicks shoved in her box nightly, is she fucking?
(Is she fuckin?) For the right price she might me
Stank hoe, I never paid for ass
So take a stray cat, and shove it in ya flat ass
Get up out my face wit that foo dang drama
Where she learn that shit? Man she get it from her mama

I foo dang on the daily, go ahead and call me shady
Bad boy on the streets, startin static since the '80s
So why you gotta front? Try and play me like a punk
If you keep talkin shit, you gon' end up in my trunk
Jackin beats from bustas, we foo dang like that
Robbin hoes for they gold then trade it in for a sack
Don't even think for a second that we high class
40 drinkin freaks with some dank and a nice ass
? identity with some eastside conflict
Bitches make me sick if they don't foo dang dick
Keep it real and I'll try to keep it real back
Try to trip in over all the bodies that I shot wit the gat
Hunt you down wit my automobile, roll down the window slow
Then punch you right in the throat
Type of shit that most people call a little fucked
But it's simple and plain, we foo dang, so don't front
[Some guy]
Yo Killa, this Tadpole
I got ya number from this bitch I know
I was the guy followin you home from the signin ??
Yo man why you ain't pull over?
I ain't no houndog or nothin but I just

[Chorus]

[Blaze]
Foo dang is what I call a hoe without a pistol
Walkin all alone (There she go) and if I see you it's on
I'm callin out old janky bitches wit no heart
Dogs with no bite that wanna bark
Reppin gold is like a crip wearin red in my hood
And I'll slap ya wit a bat like a G should (Beeitch!!)
Bitch, check yourself into the crackhead clinic
You can't get no ? bringin a bag wit bottles in it

[Anybody Killa]
Foo dangin wit a hatchet, come and get ya ass kicked
If you bring a bottle then I really wanna smash it
Sellin weed filled wit stems and seeds
Same shit for $550 but you askin a G
Now that's the kinda shit that makes a mind go crazy
2 packs of 'Ports a day and I just can't take it
I swear if 1 more hero tries to flex in my face
I'll go foo dang around the globe and make the whole world change

Sunshine,rap,AZ,2004,655,{},"Once again, firm affiliation
Like we say; the show must go on

[Chorus: 2X]
Sunshine - we hustle to the moon light
Reminisce on a good time
Cop come on boget

Yo when times get trifle
I'm subjected to street survival
See many never complete they cycle
Other retreat to bibles, living holy
But currency seem to control me, moving coldly
In the presence of old parolies
My mind mold me, keep me in mack mode like Goldie
Police know me, but ain't got enough to hold me
I follow rules, through the knowledge, swallow jewels
A form of teaching, from the streets never taught in school
You caught you lose, a wise man utilize tools
Solitude certifies all moves
So I walk this path of the old dread, that lead me off the Ave
Absorbing fast, learning from niggas I lost in the past
Its poison plays in these foul days
Housing cops and they foul ways, I'm walking through a wild maze
Holding my brain trying to maintain
Sleet hell, snow, or rain, I guess the game will never change
[Chorus]

Since the genesis, paraphernalia circle my premises
Poor images, project life drained my innocence
It's all the worst genocide, I guess the water's cursed
My old earth identify, though her soul is for the church
She prayed for peace, hoping I'm saved before she lay deceased
To say the least, the one to wise to play the streets
I know the ropes, certain niggas to slow to cope
& though I sold some Coke, it was only to stay afloat
Amongst the frozen hearted, some bending, some departed
Inhaling chocolate, tracing back to where it started
The Crack wave 2 for 5, deuce and trays
The Mack sprays, puffin' lye, truth & days
& though it sound ill, through all the foul shit, I'm down still
All around real, rough is the grounds in Brownsville
I know the ledge, meditating, holding my head
Eyes red, it's ""Doe or Die"" till I'm dead

[Chorus]

I played all positions, plus learned from each mission
Politic wit all type niggas wit different diction
I did it up, from young in some cunt, the way I hit it up
Bugging off my first Philly Blunt, and how I lit it up
But time flying, playing these corners I'll let it slide by
Smoking lye, homicide, coke supplies dry
So play the game, other slow up change the lane
Awaken, unchain the brain in exchange to take away the pain
It's a part of scriptures, put together wit different mixtures
They tricked us, got us trapped in taking pictures
Interrogating, locating, destination, estimating
Or play a part of them investigating
It's on going from them killers, to them broads hoeing
Unknowing first time felons on trial blowing
So burn your clips and sit back, learn your shit
The last of these real reps left turned legit

Time,rap,AZ,2004,7577,"{Nas,Nature}","[Verse 1: Nature]
At the ripe age of 24, I done seen it all, done it all
Some dreams stay fresh and some are spoiled
Dealin' with time, winter, spring, summer, fall
It's crazy changes, is this that made me famous?
I come a long way from Timbs, minimum wages
Stockin' caps, summer jobs, pockets flat
It's funny how my childhood idols now be coppin' crack
I ain't knockin' that, unfortunately, life's too short to see
It's only right we move accordingly at every second
I use to carry heavy weapons
Previously cocked, tucked in my shirt for every session
But hold up, a 2-6 bid made me grow up
Came home to the same damn dreams with no luck
And half the clique's strong, the other half moved on
Some with new lives and new wives, niggas live long
The foulest thing about time - it still ticks when you gone

[Verse 2: Nas]
For those who live the way I live, we came a long way
From wipin' cold outta eyelids to rap's hottest
Smokin' lye, let track guide us
Remember back then before MAC-10's, expensive bottles?
Had a sick mind, niggas taught me how to get mine
We'd often sip quarts, they get tossed at the spit line
To all niggas that the Lord seemed to gip for their time
While we plan to live forev', he had a different design
Is it safe to say, we all perish on the sacred day?
With my luck, soon as I reach the gate, they make me pay
Pray, minutes go by, Indigo high
The specialist, decked out dark specs, finessin' it
Used to play catch-a-kiss, same girls back then
Now, leave us messages, a whole lot
Travel to my old spot where we sold rock, although it's trifle
Ain't nothin' changed, just like time, it's all a cycle
[Verse 3: AZ]
Yo, wake up to the world, stay in charge of your dreams
Keep your vision, focus, get wise, enlargen your cream
Marketin' schemes, so many in the dark is unseen
Caught in between, perhaps rap was a fortunate thing
Forced to be king from hustlin', supportin' them fiends
Bustin' guns, I had no remorse as a teen
Rockin' birth stones, my first skid bid, nurse the dome
It hurts to zone, now I've realized, I'm on this Earth alone
Time ticks, devilish mind design tricks
Leave you blind quick and cause you to die behind shit
Mathematics, master 120, I'm Asiatic
Amazed with magic 'cause it's illusions that made me savage
Life change once you establish the right game
Love the night rain, found a new way to fight pain
Clocks never stop, it's all a race to the top
Tryin' to freeze time, that's why I iced the face of my watch",8717,https://images.genius.com/fb708d94440fffe20eb3e9b4d6487268.297x297x1.jpg
