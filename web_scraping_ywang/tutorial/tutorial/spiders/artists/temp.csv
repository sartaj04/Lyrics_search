I feel it in my bones I feel it in my bones I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house Such a modest mouse I can't do it alone I can't do it alone  Every time I see you in the world You always step to my girl  Ancestors told me that their girl was better She's richer than Croesus,   she's tougher than leather I just ignore all the tales of her past life Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife And punks who would laugh when they saw us together Well, they didn't know how to dress for the weather I can still see them there, huddled on Astor Snow falling slow to the sound of the master  The gloves are off,   the wisdom teeth are out What you on about? I feel it in my bones I feel it in my bones I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house Such a modest mouse I can't do it alone I can't do it alone"

And they're pointing at me And I was like ""what's wrong? what's wrong?"" And they're like ""the big tooth"" And I'm ""what? what's happening to the big tooth?"" And they're like ""It's glowing in the dark"" So, I was very easy to find at the nightclub You just see the tooth It's like a tooth, like, floating in the air, like, kind of high I think I scared like a lot of girls away OK, so, obviously all of that All of these details aren't in this song That would be too much to put in Um, but this is the song, it's called ""Little Boy"""
