To say it quickly, his mentor\n[Verse 2]\nElegant man born in 1913 in a well-off Jew and Romanian family, Delmore first graduates in the University of New York before pursuing a curriculum in Harvard in the 30s, in the philosophy department, directed by Whitehead\nThen writes a short story in the Partisan Revue, inspired by the divorce of his parents, which will be cited by TS Eliot, William Carlos William, or Ezra Pond, admired by Nabokov\nA short story that would become a classic to say it otherwise\nThe classic of a man who's barely 25\nA classic for Lou Reed too, who'll discover this piece about ten years after its publishing, while taking Creative Writing classes\nWhat you need to understand, is that Lou Reed, of whom so many people are fan, was himself fan of Delmore, absolute fan of his time, until death\nIt's moving to catch famous people admiring other people who are less famous\nMoving to realize that the figures that everybody listens to, sometimes keep quiet to themselves listen to other people\nI started liking Lou Reed when I discovered Lou Reed's humility\nA reading humility, the deference of a fan\n\n[Verse 3]\nIn 2012 Lou wrote a posthumous letter to Delmore, which is concluded by a simple word\nToo simple without any doubt, so simple that it's often mocked\nLou concluded his letter to Delmore by the word ""dream""\nAnd while he's concluding, I'm wondering if admiring someone is basically becoming responsible of their dreams\nCommitting yourself to pursuing them, committing yourself to defending them, to defending the seriousness of it, to taking over from it\nFighting the indifference\nI imagine underground like an attention relay that humans mysteriously pass to each other\nAnd I tell myself that admiring someone, it's taking the risk of taking possession of this baton\nBeing in charge of a soul, of a shared dream\nLou took over from Delmore by his own way\nWho will take over from Lou ?",7902870

I'm just scared 24 hours a day but not necessarily in New York... uh... I actually feel pretty comfortable in New York, I get scared like Sweden. You know, it's kind of empty, they're all drunk...""\n\n[Unique verse]\nThe magic and sad short story of Delmore Schwartz, published in the Partisan Revue, is called ""In Dreams Begin Responsibilities""\nIn dreams the responsibilities begin\nAnd I'm going to tell it to you\nIt's the night, we dream, a young man goеs to the movies\nThe lifе of his parents flashes up on the screen, their lives before he was born\nHis father's about to ask his mother in mariage and walks alone\nAlone in the street of Brooklyn, to meet his family-in-law\nFrom his read seat, the child sees his father wandering, daydreaming, and hesitating in his loneliness\nDoes he truly want to get married, to have a child, to settle ?\nThe son preceives the father's discomfort at the first contact with his new family, the chemistry that is right only intermittently with his fiancee\nThe shyness of the latter, the assurance of the former\nThe fear that rules both of their gestures\nThe opposite desires of this fragile couple, their bodies that walk together towards Coni Island...\nThere, the child watches the ocean, passionate, and his parents, indifferent\nHe cries\nOn the screen, there's still awkward smiles, gestures of embarrassment and suddenly, suddenly his father who's opening his mouth, about to -but why ?- ask his mother in marriage\nThat's when the young man gets up and screams towards the screen\n""Don't do that !\nIt's not too late to change your mind\nBoth of you...\nNothing good will come out of this, only remorses, hartred\nScandals and two children with a monstruous temper""\nNext to him, an old lady forces him to sit\n""Stay calm young man, sit back""\nWhich he does, but, a few minutes later when his father and his mother avoid each other, argue, and yet persist in the mariage project, the boy gets up again\n""What are you doing, what are you doing with your lives ?""\nThe old lady, this time, irritated\n""That's the last straw; it's just a movie, nothing but a movie, behave in a more responsible way !""\nIn the room, another man starts too\n""You hold these people accountable on screen while you, you're doing nothing ! We don't scream like this in a movie theater. Think about you first before accusing others. What are you doing, you ?""\nSo the boy closes his eyes\nOr rather opens them\nOn others' lives, which power do we hold ?\nAnd on ours ?\nSoon, he'll wake up, the sun around him will have already risen, it'll be the first day of this 21 years old\n[Outro]\nYou had to be equal to your dreams\nYou had to increase the doses\nBe equal to your dreals\nYou had to increase the doses\nIncrease\nIncrease\n(And I guess that I just don't know)\n(I guess)\nIncrease the doses\nIncrease\n(And I guess, I guess that I just don't know)\nIncrease",7909489
