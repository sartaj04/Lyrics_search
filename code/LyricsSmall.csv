Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash 'cause we both know how this ends

Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

2,Latch,Disclosure,"You lift my heart up
When the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me, even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on babe
Now I know what I have found

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

Now I got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

Now I got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

I'm so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it, you got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love

3,Wake Me Up,Avicii,"Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is a prize

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older

4,Firework,Katy Perry,"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night

You're original, cannot be replaced

After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road

7,Anything Could Happen,Ellie Goulding,"Stripped to the waist we fall into the river

Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over

Yes, since we found out
Since we found out

That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

After the war we said we'd fight together
(Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
(Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh)
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its color

But now I've seen it through
And now I know the truth

Anything could happen

I'll give you everything you need, oh

You stripped it right down to the wire

You'll find the light that leads home
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time

We have to tear down walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting

Handing you my heart
This love I could have
Given you from the start
Why in the hell I caught up
As my precius love
Flows past you cup
Please don't let us part
I'll give you my whole and
I'll give you my heart

Love ain't free love ain't cheap
Standing high on a mountain oh so steep
Please girl give your pain
So we cann fall in love again
All this time
That we've been waitin'
Crime of passion
Kept datin'
Let us take it from the start
And this time
I will give you my heart

I give you my love
I give you my hope
I give you anything
You want from me

I've seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,
Blown and shot out beyond belief.
Arms and legs were in the trees.

I've seen and done things I want to forget;
Coming from an unearthly place,
Longing to see a woman's face,
Instead of the words that gather pace,
The words that maketh murder.

These, these, these are the words-
The words that maketh murder.
These, these, these are the words-
The words that maketh murder.
These, these, these are the words-
Murder...

These, these, these are the words-
The words that maketh murder.

I've seen and done things I want to forget;
I've seen a corporal whose nerves were shot
Climbing behind the fierce, gone sun,
I've seen flies swarming everyone,
Soldiers fell like lumps of meat.

These are the words, the words are these.
Death lingering, stunk,
Flies swarming everyone,
Over the whole summit peak,
Flesh quivering in the heat.
This was something else again.
I fear it cannot be explained.
The words that make, the words that make
Murder.

If I didn't have anything
I wanna know would you stick around?

If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?

Let's get it diddly-down-down-down
All I want is somebody real who don't need much
A girl I know that I can trust
To be 'ere when money low
If I did not have nothing else to give but love
Would that even be enough?
Gotta need to know

Now tell me would you really ride for me?
Baby tell me would you die for me?
Would you spend your whole life with me?
Would you be there to always hold me down?
Tell me would you really cry for me?
Baby don't lie to me
If I didn't have anything
I wanna know would you stick around?

If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?

Tell me, tell me, would you want me?
Tell me, tell me, would you call me?
If you knew I wasn't balling
'Cause I need a girl who's always by my side
Tell me, tell me, do you need me?
Tell me, tell me, do you love me?
Or is you just tryna play me?
'Cause I need a girl to hold me down for life

If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?

Can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning
The pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten

I break tradition
Sometimes my tries are outside the lines
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes
But I can't live that way

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

You can't get burned if you put out the spark
I feel I just can't win let myself down again
Just raise your guard and say ""Keep your heart""

So I'd set it straight
She never know
If we die today you had me at hello

I swear that I loved you
I know I throw that word around but I mean it
I swear I fuckin' mean it

Raise your guard and raise your guard say ""Keep your heart""
And I can't win
I can't win

You need your space again
It's not the right time or place again
You lied right to my face again
In your basement we were wasted

I always try to talk at the worst times
You dated many boys I'm the worst kind
Every word I write it's the worst line
So if I hurt her feelings she hurt mine

Raise your guard and raise your guard say ""Keep your heart""
You can't get burned if you put out the spark

But now you need time to clear your mind
You're tripping over what is wrong and right
Just decide, I've been waiting all night

How to get from point A to B
Without losing sleep, without losing sleep

I will follow the electric lines
With my electric heart I then will find
A way through all these damn street signs

Of the bustling city and it's busy heart
Well i sat in your room and played my six string

Well your hair looked so good over my shoulder

She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Whitesnake's car

So tell me what you're waiting for?
I'm gonna keep it frozen here forever
There's no regretting anymore

It's worth the wait, even so far away
I'm making the night mine until the day I die
No lights to break when you're hanging by fate
You know what it feels like when you're dancing blind

All alone, just the beat inside my soul
Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold
In the zone, where the beat is uncontrolled
I know what it feels like
Come on, make me feel alive

Meet me under shining lights
I've been waiting right here all my life
Feelings you can't deny that you're living, open up your eyes
And I just wanna sink into your crazy laughter
Come on, make me feel until the pain don't matter
Every second here makes my heart beat faster
Finally think I found what I'm chasing after

All alone, just the beat inside my soul
Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold
In the zone, where the beat is uncontrolled
I know what it feels like
Come on, make me feel alive

All alone, just the beat inside my soul

You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older

187,Take Me to Church,Hozier,"My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the Heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick"", you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
A-, Amen, Amen, Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Oh, oh, Amen, Amen, Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

Love at first sight

I make fun of your belly
And tell you to do some crunches
And you say ""yeah, well your ass jiggles
Go and do some lunges""

Be careful making wishes in the dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage
I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite
My songs know what you did in the dark

So light em up up up, light em up up up
Light em up up up, I'm on fire
So light em up up up, light em up up up
Light em up up up, I'm on fire

Ooh oh oh oh (in the dark-dark)
Ooh oh oh oh (in the dark-dark)

All the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just dies
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything, except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love
Then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back out the monster that you see
My songs know what you did in the dark

So light em up up up, light em up up up
Light em up up up, I'm on fire
So light em up up up, light em up up up
Light em up up up, I'm on fire

Hush, hush, we both can't fight it

There's an old man sittin' next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

He says, ""Son can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
But there's some place that he'd rather be

As a smile ran away from his face
""Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Sing us the song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while

And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say man what are you doin' here?

I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone

But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you're talkin', and where you're walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk

As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

Been spendin' most their lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams

I'm an educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger, fool

Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life, do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?

That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Been spendin' most their lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'

They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

Please take me away from here
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said, ""Farewell"" (they said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (jar, jar, jar)

I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention

Under covers, staying dry and warm

'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

When you kiss my nose, the feeling shows

270,White Sky,Vampire Weekend,"An ancient business, a modern piece of glasswork
Down on the corner that you walk each day in passing
The elderly sales clerk won't eye us with suspicion
The whole, immortal corporation's given its permission

A little stairway, a little piece of carpet
A pair of mirrors that are facing one another
Out in both directions, a thousand little Julias
That come together in the middle of Manhattan

You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

Around the corner, the house that modern art built
A house for modern art to keep it out the closets
Of people who might own it, the sins of pride and envy
And on the second floor the Richard Serra skatepark

You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

Sit on the park wall, ask all the right questions
""Why are the horses racing taxis in the winter?""
Look up at the buildings, imagine who might live there
Imagining your Wolfords in a bowl upon the sink there

You waited since lunch

Between human beings and animals that you should know about

Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes, I'm Siskel, yes, I'm Ebert
And you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch
You want it rough, you're out of bounds
I want you smothered, want you covered
Like my Waffle House hash browns
Comin' quicker than FedEx, never reaching apex
Just like Coca-Cola stock, you are inclined
To make me rise an hour early just like Daylight Savings Time

Hieroglyphics, let me be Pacific, I wanna be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean
Means small craft advisory
So if I capsize in your thighs, high tide, B-5, you sunk my battleship
Please turn me on, I'm Mr. Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours, I'll show you mine, ""Tool Time""

You should've known better

Gonna love you, gonna love you

Black, black widow, baby

I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you I'm doin' whatever works
You had never meet nobody, that'll do ya how I do ya
That'll bring ya to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah

That'll make ya beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'd do any and every thing for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gaspin' for air, and you lean forward
'Til you have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And there's nothing but me on it (on it, on it)

Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours when you want it, I want it
Promise I need that
'Til I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit

Mo' money mo' problems, when I get it I'm a pile it up
Yeah I'm dope wonder bread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm whippin' up shows and 'em fans goin' wild with us
Tell mommy I'm sorry
This life is a party

Remember you was a kid
Reminisce days of the innocence
Now it's Chiddy Bang, Google me in the images
Follow me, follow me I'm the leader
And when I park cars I don't pay for the meter
I remember I was younger as a kid it was the best
I used touch on all the pretty girls at recess
I'm at my peak yes, I won't leave yet
Serial style, cereal aisle need Chex
I can make these rappers run like a hard drill
Rock band show you how the guitar feel
And I could care less how y'all feel
I got the flow to make a bitch do a cartwheel
This is that good just puff it and relax bro
And you can get it free don't worry 'bout the tax though
And Xaphoone, thank you for the crack
But I play a Ron Bergundy I anchor on the track like that

Aye yo I once was a kid all I had was a dream
Mo' money no problems, when I get it I'm a pile it up
Now I'm dope wonder bread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm whippin' up shows and 'em fans goin' wild with us
Tell mommy I'm sorry
This life is a party
I'm never growing up

Can I please get a little bit of knowledge
Somebody tell Roth that I don't love college
'Cause the real world's kinda like Real World
And it's drama so you are Svetlana and I'm just a rhymer
Swimmin' in the water tryin' to dodge the piranhas and fly to Bahamas
Pretty little momma, Chiddy in the spot
Where you at pretty lady show me what you got
They say why you rappin' for the kids for
I said my clothes come fitted, the Lids store
This summer you can catch me on a big tour
I'm high grade, I think they need to quiz more
Let me get wit' ya, don't let the kid hit ya
I'm the photo album Valletta has, big picture
The rule is, the dude is, so up, so chuck I'm a cool kid

Aye yo I once was a kid all I had was a dream

So she ran away in her sleep
Dreamed of para-para-paradise

Every time she closed her eyes

When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly

Dream of para-para-paradise

Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a coward
Face just showers, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Bitter moments got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
There go my regards but regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Get mad 'cause a quarter million on my necklace
D.U.I., never said I was driving reckless

Clean next, get a call, just a lil' visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality, see when you're blessed just kill critics
Bugatti never meant I'm rich, just God fearing
Look at me steering, got the blogs staring
Gotta good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren
Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet

303,Heart Attack,Demi Lovato,"Putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

Never put my love out on the line
Never said yes to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care, I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair, then make 'em bounce like a basketball

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It's just not fair, pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air, it feels so good, but you know it hurts

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

The feelings got lost in my lungs
They're burning, I'd rather be numb (rather be numb)
And there's no one else to blame (no one else to blame)
So scared, I take off, and I run
I'm flying too close to the sun
And I burst into fla-fla-flames

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night ended up online, I'm screwed
Oh, well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops, and we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards and got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard last Friday night
We went streaking in the park, skinny-dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law, always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-whoa

But this Friday night
Do it all again
But this Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

And you won't stop 'til I'm there

Fall, sometimes I fall so fast
When I hit that bottom crash
You're all I have

Oh, it seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

How do you know?
Everything I'm about to say
Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face
I hope it never goes away
Yeah

On a Monday, I am waiting
And by Tuesday, I am fading
Into your arms
So I can breathe

Oh, it seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better

You should've made it better

We should've stood together

If I'm not breathing with you
I can't sleep
If all I'm dreaming is you

Can't you see
I've got no air without you
I can't breathe

And the tears froze on my face

You were so cold

Now I can't breathe

We could have everything
But all we got is heartache and pain
I can't catch my breath
It's getting harder to speak

You should be proud of me
But you're too insecure and too vain
We should've been forever
I wanted you forever

Now I can't breathe
If I'm not breathing with you
I can't sleep
If all I'm dreaming is you

Can't you see
I've got no air without you

And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone

Had a feeling that I could be someone

He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his

She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

And I work in a market as a checkout girl

You'll find work and I'll get promoted

Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

They think this thing is a highway
If it was our way, we'd have a tempo change every other time change
'Cause our minds change on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music I don't know how I would have fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless, honest
There's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity's only free when I'm playing shows

They say, ""stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They be alive tomorrow?

I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat, in a gas mask, if you ask Zack
He's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's backtrack
Back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is, there's another list that exists
And no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless

That I'm gonna make it out alive

Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus

Heroin drip, no more so

And I stepped outside
And I was like, momma, this air bubble right here
It's gonna make me fly
I hit that court and when I jumped
I jumped, I swear I got so high
I touched the net, mom, I touched the net
This is the best day of my life

Air Max's were next
That air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffin', the tread
At school, I was so cool
I knew that I couldn't crease 'em
My friends couldn't afford 'em
Four stripes on their Adidas

On the court I wasn't the best
But my kicks were like the pros
Yo, I stick out my tongue
So everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, book bag was so dope
And then my friend Carlos' brother
Got murdered for his Fours, whoa

See he just wanted a jump shot
But they wanted his Starter coat, though
Didn't wanna get caught, from Genesee Park to Othello
You'd get clowned for those Pro Wings, with the velcro
Those were not tight
I was trying to fly without leaving the ground

Wanted to be him
I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool, and I wanted to fit in
I wanted what he had, America, it begins

I wanna fly
Can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high

I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

We want what we can't have
The commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it
Got to show 'em, so exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes
I would never hoop in

Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yeah, but I'm part of a movement
My movement told me be a consumer
And I consumed it
They told me to just do it
I listened to what that swoosh said

Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
Are you stupid, don't crease 'em
Just leave 'em in that box
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That's my air bubble and I'm lost if it pops

We are what we wear
We wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror
And think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change or stay in my box?
These Nikes help me define me
But I'm trying to take mine, off

I wanna fly
Can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high

I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

It started out with what I wear to school
That first day, like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am

What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins
And now I see it's just another pair of shoes",Musixmatch

I would be swinging from a broken tree
I would be down on my back looking up at stars at night

You know that I would turn back just to fight the whites of iron eyes

When I hear that wind and I think of Spring
Underneath an open window a carved out sign and
often I would fight with my mind

Saltwater brine where you hung your crown
When you washed your eyes in last night's tea
I thought you might come out from the dream to find that

Underneath the pine grew a patch of thyme
that I burned for six days in the sun
'til I heard the distant sound of drums

Oh the queen had come and the King had died
and my forehead burned but I closed my eyes
and my forehead burned but I closed my eyes

Before I go I've got to run, down the street
to the market cove where I could
find six seeds to bring back to the yard
and plant underneath the birch tree
No white skies or red sunlight
In the saltwater brine
My forehead burned but I closed my eyes

I bet her momma never told her why

She wants from her time
And when she wakes up
And makes up her mind

She'll see I'm not so tough

And all her presents from her uptown boys

You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

And when she's walking
She's looking so fine
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine

I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

On a cold, dark winter's night

It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever

I've forgotten what I started fightin' for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door

I've been running 'round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm followin' you, girl

How can we say forever?

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it, baby?
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end, if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Maybe I just wouldn't know what to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit? Do we distort the facts?

Fragments of light shine away from the dead
They fantasize fury, no time left to stop
Its darkness approaching now we're at a loss

Drink from the fountain of youth and never age again
Sometimes we jump across to every cloud
Fly away get lost and never be found

Drink from the fountain of youth and never age again
Sometimes we jump across to every cloud

Stealing the colour and life from my skin

Darkness approaches now we're at a loss

Never said but nearly sung about a million ways

Trickled through the lengthy web of friend
I over thought but understood
Distant look but looking good
And not the other way

But you fail to remember

Do I still cross your mind?
Your face still distorts the time

With heat struck afternoons long through
Those idle dreams go back to you
The echo's seem somewhat displaced
Ever further from your face, I'm drifting off to
Bored of mere flirtations
That's what's made of constellations that I've sought
Was this only in my head
Just like most things go misread
When overthought

For something we won't find

Was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over
The scars began to fade
We said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade

All I ever wanted
The secrets that you keep
All you ever wanted
The truth I couldn't speak
'Cause I can't see forgiveness
And you can't see the crime
If we both keep on waiting
For what we left behind

Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled, listen even back when we was broke my team ill

No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory
I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her, ""Hey, what's good?
""Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches, ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out of touch with reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick em' to the door
Nigga you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt before she leave
I'ma need my shirt back
Nigga you know how it go

One time for my LA hoes

Shame on you""
Fool me, we can't get fooled again

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

My only regret was too young for Nia Long

469,I Wanna Get Better,Bleachers,"Hey, I hear the voice of a preacher from the back room
Calling my name and I follow just to find you
I trace the faith to a broken down television and put on the weather
And I've trained myself to give up on the past 'cause
I frozen time between hearses and caskets
Lost control when I panicked at the acid test
I wanna get better

While my friends were getting high and chasing girls down parkway lines
I was losing my mind because the love, the love, the love, the love, the love
That I gave wasted on a nice face
In a blaze of fear I put a helmet on a helmet
Counting seconds through the night and got carried away

So now I'm standing on the overpass screaming at the cars
""Hey, I wanna get better!""

I didn't know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better

I go up to my room and there's girls on the ceiling
Cut out their pictures and I chase that feeling
Of an eighteen year old who didn't know what loss was
Now I'm a stranger
And I miss the days of a life still permanent
Mourn the years before I got carried away

So now I'm staring at the interstate screaming at myself
""Hey, I wanna get better!""

I didn't know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better

'Cause I'm sleeping in the back of a taxi
I'm screaming from my bedroom window
Even if it's gonna kill me

Woke up this morning early before my family
From this dream where she was trying to show me
How a life can move from the darkness
She said to get better
So I put a bullet where I shoulda put a helmet
And I crash my car cause I wanna get carried away

That's why I'm standing on the overpass screaming at myself
""Hey, I wanna get better!""

I didn't know I was lonely 'til I saw your face

Who cares if hell awaits?

And we're burning all the bridges now
Watching it go up in flames
No way to build it up again

You made a vow, never get mad
You play the game, though it's unfair

Night after night, bar after club
Dropping like flies, who woke you up?
On the front lawn, sprinklers turn on
It's not your house, where'd you go wrong?

Flying like a cannonball, falling to the earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

There comes a time, in a short life
Turn it around, get a re-write
Call it a dark night of the soul
Ticking of clocks, gravity's pull

Flying like a cannonball, falling to the earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt

It's not inviting now
Don't deny what you meant

You got a feeling, or at least you can pretend
You wanna light it, you wanna light it

That never rang and all I needed was a call
That never came to the corner of First and Amistad

Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?

In the end, everyone ends up alone
Losin' her, the only one who's ever known
Who I am, who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know how long she will be next to me

And you never left me no messages, you never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve, takin' all I want

Avoid their eyes, get lost in the weight

Brush shoulders with walls, underneath them all

Tied to your fate, bound to the lines
We dip and left in unstable air, a hole in my gut
Lead in my legs, dust from the tracks still choke this call

I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Check, check, yo, I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, 'wishing you was' niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss
Honies looking all ""they wish"" - come on boo, gimme kiss

If you want to go and take a ride with me

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town

The way you put it on me, how you got me chasin' you
And I could care less, I could give a damn

You're a down ass b- who don't take no sh-
Keep it real though and still look fly

Real talk I'ma tell you out the whip
It ain't yo' face and it ain't yo' hips
It's how you roll my w- and lick dem lips
And, when I dip shawty you don't even trip
You give me rubberbands for my grip
You the fly b- steppin up out my whip
I'm your n- girl we like ""This done""
And when the hook say you got me like dat dere I'm sprung

Oooh she got me doin the dishes
Anything she want for some kisses
I'm cookin' for her when she gets hungry
All she doin' is actin' like she want me
She cuttin' off all my homies
Even all my other 'ronies
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinkin 'bout it lately
Man! She really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her
But now I'm leavin' quickly
Before she come and try to get me

I ain't never been a sucker for love
Never even had a gilrfriend 'til I started f- with her
Ain't never even knocked her down
And she hooked on awards tryin to lock me down
With one flick of the tongue I was sprung
And we didn't get done 'til fo' or five in the mornin
She had me deep in the zone
You get a brand new wardrobe but baby you ain't goin home
The new Jag and all the Louis bags
Chanel and Excata straight from Belle Harbor
I told my homeboys I'll holla
I got plans for a date, my girl want steaks
And she prefer Benihana's
We can go from Monday to Sunday, don't even matter 'bout the money
I'm stuck on her, never shoulda let her s- on it
Shoulda hit her up and sent her home the next mornin

Oooh so we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin what I want to
With nobody tellin me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feelin so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness
But I'm feelin kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her
Now I'm leavin quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin everythang with me

It all falls down (we gon' set this party off right)
I'm tellin' you all (Westside, Westside)
It all falls down, oh, when it all (we gon' set this party off right)

Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

Oh, when it all, it all falls down (uh)
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all (c'mon, c'mon)
It all falls down
And when it falls down, oh, when it all (and when it all falls down)

Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

Oh, when it all (c'mon, c'mon)
It all falls down (and when it falls down, who you gon' call now?)
I'm tellin' you all (come on, come on)
It all falls down, oh, when it all (and when it all falls down)

I say, ""Fuck the police, "" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with twenty-five thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
'Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

Oh, when it all (yeah, c'mon, c'mon)
It all falls down (and when it falls down, who you gon' call now?)
I'm tellin' you all (c'mon, c'mon)
It all falls down (and when it falls down)

Oh, when it all (Chi-Town, Chi-Town)
It all falls down (We gon' show 'em how we get down)

Girl, I see you, in them Apple Bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl, I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon '04 Range
Still sexy when you smoke that flame
Jerk it like a chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven, the way that she talk
Switchin' to freaky, so I'm lovin' the way that she walk
You lookin' good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career goin' sky high
Takin' you home to the crib in the Chi
And every time I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watchin' you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screamin', ""My, my, my, my!""
Walk on the carpet, with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kickin' it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freakin' you with whip cream
I can see you on stage at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's and doin' big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life

Candlelights 'fore you take a bath

I'ma get you Jimmy Choo and Marc Jacobs bags
I can cop her a 2003
Make her smile, when she sees Spre's
I can get you on CDs, and DVDs
Take you to BB's, and BCBG
I can get you in the places to be into
The people to know or show you things to get into
I wanna be your lover and your confidant
And protect you from others, don't ever let a brother pimp you
If you want the stars, you can reach 'em, girl
Y'all, take a look at her, she got such an astonishin' body
I can see you in some Gucci or Robert Cavalli
And I bet she gon' put a hurt on 'em hard in the party
And you know you kill 'em in the club we go
You was born to be a pro, how you pose takin' photos
And I love you 'cause you freaky with the door closed
Drop it to the flo', let that go when you roll slow
And I love it when I hit it from the back
And you get on top of me and have a brother goin' oh-oh

Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope for a four finger ring
One of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate It or Love It, the underdog's on top

Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em
Kill a nigga on my song and really do it

Ten G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe you me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped, like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride and if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on, see how time fly?

Hate It or Love It, the underdog's on top

From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on, like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted, I think
What if Marie Baker got that abortion? I love you, ma

Ten G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe you me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped, like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride and if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on, see how time fly?

Hate It or Love It, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate It or Love It, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on, like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted, I think
What if Marie Baker got that abortion? I love you, ma

Hate It or Love It, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate It or Love It, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me",Musixmatch

I get high, high, high, high (all the time)
High

Every day I need an ounce and a half
S.P., the only flower that you know with a bounce-and-a-half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave

I get, high 'cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt just to ease the pain that humble me now
And I'd rather roll somethin' up, 'cause if I'm sober, dawg
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up

I get high as a kite, I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker 'case I'm dyin' tonight
So I roll 'em up back-to-back, fat as I could
You got beef with Styles P, I come and to slide to the hood

I get high, high, high, high (every night)
I get high, high, high, high (all the time)
I get high, high, high, high, high

A yo, I smoke like a chimney, matter of fact, I smoke like a gun
When a killa see his enemy, I smoke like Bob Marley did
Add to that, that I smoke like the hippies did back in the '70s
Spit with the finishing touch
Get this, that I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes
I get high when bullets hit faces after words exchanged

I get a rush off the blunt and the walls, you understand
Like the M-5 pedal when it's touchin' the floor
I get high 'cause fuck it, what's better to do?
And I'ma never give a fuck, 'cause I'm better than you

I get high, high, high, high (every day)
I get high, high, high, high (every night)

I get high, high, high, high (every night)
I get high, high, high, high (all the time)
I get high, high, high, high, high

I'ma smoke 'til my lungs collapse
I'm from a era where niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful
I smoke weed 'cause time seem precious, and I know what a hour do

High for a livin', gots to ride for a livin'
With my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin'
Shit, I get as high as I could
'Cause if you see things like I see things
'Cause I'ma die in the hood

Motherfucker, understand it's full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die
This is S.P., dump it in, you bitch, I get high

I get high, high, high, high (every day)
I get high, high, high, high (every night)
I get high on your memory, high on your memory (all the time)

Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe

Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?

If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, would you poof and disappear
Like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends that you feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink, you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that (like that)

Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now (woo)
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?

Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving?
Are you mad 'cause I'm asking you twenty-one questions?
Are you my soulmate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

Would you love me if I was down and out?

With my ding dong take her tongue and tickle the bong
Hold on, that's the only one I gotta do that for

I like to lay back, relax, and enjoy my time
And with my eyes roll back and my toes curl
(I love when you do that girl)
'Til it comes time for me to have to give her hers

Tell me what you want, do you want it missionary
With your feet crammed into the head board?
Do you want it from the back with your face in the pillow
So you can yell as loud as you want to?

How 'bout on the floor? Do you want it on the chair?
Do you want it over here? Do you want it over there?
Do you want it in ya pussy? Do you want it in ya ass?

Throw in that Al Green and juice the Impala
Lay my jewels on my collar

And I'm buggin', 'cuz I can see you right in the hood when I pass
I'm never stable 'cuz business is on my ass

And I admit I been the type to hit and split

But you can't blame me for the females that I been gettin' wit

Or can this be your girlfriends tryna to sandwich me
My hearts colder than sandwich meat

Fuck with the S the T, I-D-E-S

Nevertheless I'm hella fresh
Rolling joints like a cigarette
So pass it cross the table like ping-pong
I'm gone, beating my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around a 40
And when it comes to get another stogie

Niggas all kick in like Shinobi
Nummy ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be popping to let my friend hit shit
Unless you pull out the phat crispy
5 dollar bill on the real before its history
Cause niggas be having them vacuum lungs

An if you let em hit it for free
You hella dum-da-dum-dum!
I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoiding all the dick-teasers
Skeezers and weirdos
That be fuckin' off the land like ""Where tha bomb at?""

Give me 2 bucks, you take a puff and pass my bomb back
Suck up the dank like a Slurpee
The serious bomb will make a nigga go delirious like Eddie Murphy
I got more Growing Pains than Maggie

To take the dank out of the baggie

I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' bout 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I been shot 'em

Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; my niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

Me? I like the limited edition, and khaki, and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

Don't get me wrong, man
And Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four
But you got one, man (big boy)

give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

We up in Foot Locker; I'm lookin' like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo'
Cause she's just standin there as if I'm shootin free throws
I said, ""Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes""
She said, ""I love you Murph especially in the white 'n blue""
I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice""
And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), ""Thanks for the advice""

I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers the Broncos the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops, which are clear so
But this tims and fat laces with it is cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit them lil' dots in the toe
Then I'm stopping this dough that I'm spending fa show
On dem Nike Air Force, ""NE"" behind the ""O""

O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces at what wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with the electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, you know I'm buyin dem

Now don't nothing get the hype on first site like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose ya heard me kinda like my daytons

give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

I wore spurs at first now theres tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (wow) fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

Now some time I get em free some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

Now where da boxes where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine (beep mine)
Maybe once or twice but never three times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love pumas and shell toes
But can't nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl

give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs

For we been together like Nike Airs and crisp tees
S dots with polo fleeces
Purple label shit with the logo secret
Gimme couple years, shit, I might just sneak in
A couple words and like peaches and herb

We'll be reunited and it feels so hood
Have the whole world saying, ""How you still so good?""
Well, I do, this in my slumber summer
I ain't none of these half-assed newcomers
You know how I do Summer, I drop heat when you bring the sun up
The combo make niggaz act up, I pick the gun up
Niggaz back up, they know I'm not no fronter
I don't talk shit, I just flip it, ya

Sorry Lance, I'm just trying to advance my quotes
I ain't making you the butt of my jokes
But let's not stray from what I came to say
To my beloved, think we need sometime away
They say if you love it, you should let it out its cage
And fuck it, if it comes back you know it's there to stay
It's tugging at my heart but this time apart is needed
From the public, who should've gave me the Pulitz'

Instead, gave me they ass to kiss
But you know me, thugging 'til the casket dips
But still shine light down on all my peers
I know they weird some queer, I still want them to share
And all the success I received, I know you can't believe
I still love 'em, but they don't love me
They like the drunk uncle in your family
You know they lame, you feel ashamed, but you love 'em the same

It's like when niggaz make subliminal records
If it ain't directed directly at me, I don't respect it
You don't really want it with Hov for the record
I put a couple careers on hold, you could be next kid
Keep entering the danger zone
You gon' make that boy Hov put your name in a song
If you that hungry for fame, motherfucker, c'mon
Say when take ten paces and spin

But on another note, 'bout to take another vaca'
On another boat, goddamn a motherfucker rode
His way out the hood and I pray that I stay out for good
But any day you know a nigga could
Try and play like he Suge then I gotta play like Dutch Schultz
You pass the dutchie, I blast you, trust me
Niggaz can't fuck with me
I'm in a good mood, you lucky, I got a good groove

And I ain't trying to fuck my thing up
But I will lay down a couple green bucks, get you cleaned up
Now, I'm Pulp Fiction, Colt four-fifth
And young niggaz that blast for me, no religion
Listen here, Summer baby
I just believe it's the right thing to do
I got a brand-new bitch, corporate America
She showing me a lot of action right now

And I know you put me on my feet and all
But I mean, it's time for me to grow
You gotta let me go, baby, you gotta let me go
I'm done for now so one for now
Possibly forever, we had fun together
But like all good things, we must come to an end
Please show the same love to my friends, dear Summer",Musixmatch

It's a life or death situation, man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy Kanye to the
Chi-Town, what's going on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk

How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her, her son's on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till

She was with me before the deal she been tryna be mine
She a delta so she been throwing that dynasty sign
No use me tryna be lying
I've been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire
How I used two lifelines?

In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the making, man

I really apologize for everything right now man
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said like six weeks
You know we had reconstru-
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw

I looked in the mirror, half of my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This is what I gotta say right here dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah
Uh

What if somebody from the Chi that was ill
Got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking 'bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down

And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye his whole life changed

If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe

My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I looked like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
It was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael

I must got a angel
'Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash

And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid s- that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

You know what I'm saying?
When the doctor told me I had a, um
I was goin' to have a plate in my chin
I said, ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on""

Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac
Like Vida Guerra, ass took her to the top
She'll give you some brain, you let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cot
Picture that, like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was Eye Candy in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she wouldn't get far cause five hundred dollars
Can't get you that far, how you get that far
And all these new video bitches tryin to be Melyssa Ford
But they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen, but behind closed doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards, ha ha

You wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
You wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed
It would be just a waste of time

Game you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these
Bitches knowin' damn well they gon' call me
The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen
Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team

Now ask yourself this question, umm
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo
Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo

In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fuckin with Scott
I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case
She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes
And ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyonce from Jay
But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day
The things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face
Stabbed Un in the stomach
She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman, on that superhero shit
Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'
Impala, forget the double D's
I put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Toccara

And I see the same bitch that was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video

And I see the same bitch, that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'

Got the gold thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas

Super-good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker

But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through this city with my high-beams on

Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wise friend on
If you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on

Smokin' on dubs in clubs, blowin' up like cocoa puffs
Sippin' Bud, gettin' perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough scratch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted, while I'm entertainin'
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin'
I hang with Hannibal Lector (hot shit) so feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (what?)

I'm from the Lou and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause, I'm righteous above the law
Playa my style's raw, I'm ""Born to Mack"" like Todd Shaw

Miss my family on the east, but fuck it I can't leave L.A.
Every meeting that I be in, trust me I just lead the way
I fucked three times before 3 today, piece of cake
Never gave a fuck 'bout what the teachers say, cause either way
I'ma just do me, and she said me too, I said ""s'il vous plait""
Walking out the club with me and TMZ is out here
Ain't no secret safe
If that's your girl, why's she in my section?
If that's your girl, why's she doing role play
Going both ways like an intersection?
Stole her like an interception
But you can have her back she asks a million questions

I don't think about yesterday

Only time I'm second place is when I'm at my second place
Made 300 then doubled that, I guess you call that 2nd base
How many come ups until it's destiny, yeah
How many come ups until it's meant to be, yeah
I hear them talking, that don't get to me
That ain't shit to me, same dude, different dream
This is me (this is me)

Nothing pretty but her face
Money hungry, nothing skinny but her waist, uh
She come from money, but she spent it on her titties and her face, oh
If you really wanna know, these women, man they come and go, ayy
'Cause one minute she's the one, the next you really never know, ayy, ayy
'Cause she don't know a damn thing about love
She don't know a damn thing at all

My last album, spent 52 weeks there
Almost finished with the second, you should be scared
Storms coming you should go inside and prepare
No shortcuts, it ain't no cheats there
I brought the whole city out like a street fair
And fuck it I'm the coldest white rapper in the game
Since the one with the bleached hair
Yeah, they love it when I talk shit
I get around, yeah I'm on my 2Pac shit
I kinda feel there's no girl I could not get
I'm not found at the function if it's not lit
Yeah, it's Nathan that no one can tell me
I made it here dolo, nobody to help me
From the Bay, the birthplace of the hyphy
So bitch come and say to my face you don't like me

It's like I'm always found where the troubles at
Drinking brown shit now I'm off cup of that
Your girl's on me, what's up with that?
If I like her, all the shit will really take is a double tap
Having visions of fucking an A list singer, Kardashian, or a Jenner
But Ye's got Kim, Tyga swooped up Kylie
So there's one left watch me go get her
Yeah, they tell me calm down
Fuck that I'm too lit can't calm down
I'm so drunk right now I might fall down
And I don't give a fuck how boring do y'all sound?
Up and down on a Wednesday

601,Lemme Freak,Lil Dicky,"Drunk, faded, browned out, looking all shady
Two months since I fucked a lady
Young man dick going crazy
Standard Saturday, I'm about to get a cab and masturbate
Then I see a hot girl, look back at Dave
Lemme get your cat girl, no Hathaway

That's what I thought not what I said to her
Instead, I walk up to her, like I know you heard of the kid
You heard what I did, you heard of my shit, the murderous spit
She's like, ""Naw, you're being weird, what are you talking about?""
I'm like, ""Aw""
Pulling out my phone, like a boss, YouTube 'bout to get her off
But as I type the y-o-u, some porno pop up
I'm like, ""Hold up, how did, that's not even me
Like, I don't jerk off mobily""

Then her friends coming up
And wanna know if everything is okay
I'm like, ""Naw, this a rape, you can't tell?
Gimme a break, please, get the heck away""
I turned to her, ""Let me buy you a drink"", she like, ""Fine""
Told the man two Patron, she like, lime
Said he tried twice, the card got declined

I'm like, ""Ah, this is a, could it be a machine issue?
He was like, ""Naw, I was like, obviously there's something wrong
I got dough, like I'm not broke
I got donuts with the same card like about an hour ago""
He like, ""Dude, I don't know""
Now I'm looking at the girl she just wanna go
And I ain't talking 'bout with me, bro, I mean alone
I got one more chance to prove myself, so I'm like

Look, I'm athletic, girl, I've gotten several Rec League MVP's
At my crib I've got some pizza, plus a little bit of weed
In my room I got a TV, plus I recently did sheets
Girl, I even have a fridge that has the water on the door
Like with the crushed ice

You know I don't give a damn, what you playing right now
This is me coming at you as a man right now
Lemme freak, lemme freak, god dammit, lemme freak
Just lemme freak, please God, just lemme freak

The girl from the first verse, somehow let me fuck
Fast-forward, seven months, we in love
Some real serious relationship type shit
Despite this, I ain't fucked for days
Tried last night, but was pushed away
But I've been acting well-behaved today, I smell okay
Adele Pandora's playing, now she laying
On the floor and I'm praying this bitch is horny
I go and give her a smooch

She kissing Dicky back, so I play with her boobs
Bad move, she don't like that
Bad mood, her boss being mean to her
Via email, she wanna write back
I'm like, ""Right now?""
She like, ""Yeah, what do I say, can you just help me?""
""Oh, okay, what's the context?""

Then she like, ""Well, he talks to Jane before coming to me""
""Who's Jane again?"" I said
She like, ""Wow, you should know that""
""Okay, I guess I forgot""
She like, ""Dude, that's my other boss""
""Okay, true, so shouldn't your first boss
Go to the other boss, before you? Right?""

""But Jane isn't hands-on"", she yelled
""Okay, well I just don't understand the dynamic then
I don't work with these people"", she started crying
""Wait stop, what the fuck is this?""
""Naw, you don't ever take my side""
About a hour later 'til I'm on her good side
We in bed, hand on her good thighs
I try to kiss, she like, good night, but I'm like

Look, I just turned off The Departed for a movie 'bout a bee
I've been cutting back on farting, tweeting, arguing and weed
Yesterday I wore a cardigan at dinner with your sweet
And supportive aunt during the fourth quarter of the Eagles
Now reward it

You know I don't give a damn, what you playing right now
This is me coming at you as a man right now
Lemme freak, lemme freak, god dammit, lemme freak
Just lemme freak, please God, just lemme freak

Fast-forward some more, June 16th 2074
Old LD looking old as fuck, still with the same ho, holding up
But my life sucks, legs hurt, friends dead, real terse
My dick looking like it's tinfoil
Her tits looking like they hard-boiled eggs
On top of that, she insane
Like, I don't even think she knows who I am
Our kids moved away, we've been doing the same shit for days

Maybe months, who knows, probably going to die soon
Pretty scared, I ain't even gonna lie to you
Think about it all day, on my last legs
But I'm going out with a bang
I got pills they invented back in '57

I took five, that's a bit excessive
I look high, take a look at my thighs
And good god that's a little erection, it'll work though
Now I've gotta find the ho, I'm pretty much blind at this point
I don't know if I mentioned that yet, but I am
Made my way into the bedroom and there she is, I'm like

Look, I don't know if you're aware that
You've been throwing out my shoes
What I do know is, I'm sick of doing nothing here with you
All my blood is in my dick, I'm probably dying pretty soon
Are you even comprehending what I'm saying?
Please acknowledge that you hear me

Alters my walk to limpin'
Since I love the feel, I guess I'm passionately pimpin'

Bullied through streets, powder I pushed and shoved
In that ol' Virginny
Out of ten niggas, nine are guinea
No money, all they know is gimme, got semis waitin'

Each year, a diffferent bitch wonder
Who wing she gon' fall under, Push' or Mal'
Gonz or Grimes, wit' me, with thoughts of fuckin' them cross her mind

So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look
I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook
Pack it up, sell it triple-price, fuck the books
Where we re-up, re-locate, we off them rooks
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look

Seems like they all gonna coming to me
In regards to my paper, now they guessin' my weight
They fast to predict the outcome of my fate

Wonderin' 'bout Clipse and if they got what it take
""Malice, he think he hard, tough guy of the clique
And Pusha, he walk around like he swear he the shit
You right on both counts, bitch, Clipse is us
And there are some things that you don't discuss
Don't ask me 'bout the Neptunes and what's they fare
Don't ask about the loud screamin' chick with the hair
Don't ask about my music, and how that's comin' 'bout
Don't ask about my album, or when's it comin' out
Cause I feel like you really being funny on the sly
Now face down, layin' on your tummy, or you die
I tried being humble, humble get no respect
Now the first sign of trouble, that's a hole up in your neck
Plus, what I look like spendin' my nights in jail
I could never be a thug, they don't dress this well
I reside in VA, ride in VA
Most likely when I die, I'm gon' die in VA
Virginia's for lovers, but trust there's hate here
For out-of-towners, who think that they gon' move weight here
Ironic, the same same place I'm makin' figures at
That there's the same land they used to hang niggas at, in Virginia

I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook
Pack it up, sell it triple-price, fuck the books
Where we re-up, re-locate, we off them rooks
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look
I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook
Pack it up, sell it triple-price, fuck the books
Where we re-up, re-locate, we off them rooks

Southside let's ride (say what)
And if you love what you do, do what you feel
Then I know you gonna mark my words
I drop shit like birds
And it's about the time for yo' ass to get served
Just lay it on down, just lay it on down
While we relax to the tight raps, and the fat tracks
That a nigga Timbaland put down
Oh yes, let's get it on down to the nitty grit
Don't have time for the petty shit
Cause I got mo' dick, than a lil' bit
And time flies, when I'm having fun
I can make a hoe get like Forrest Gump and just ""run baby run""
I guess that they can't handle this
The brother's just too scandalous
If you don't wanna get freaked,
Get up out my way just like in an ambulance (say what)
Gitty up gitty up ride on to the real, lay in death to the fake
And tell your boyfriend just to chill, don't player hate!
Kick back relax and just take off yo' shoes

Get the cut up, then I cut out
Why you standing there wit yo' butt out (whoo)
And it's always in the back of my mind
Whatever the place, whatever the time
Even in College Park after dark I'ma get that sunshine
Closer than close, closer than most, then I'm all up in ya
But beginners give me a thigh, breast, and leg like Mrs. Winter
And let dinner be served
Can I get it on a platter, shatter your bladder
And put so much light in yo' life I'll make the roaches scatter
The wetter the better, I'm ready to get ya
Gotta have that rabbit like that cheddar
So I can freak you like I just met ya

Reminisce like Mary, I gotta pop that cherry
Kinda like that coochie, you wanna be my hoochie?
Better than my adversary
Don't be so scary
I, never thought that you could act up
Make a nigga wanna back up
Keep it tight through the night while I wet this track up
So we can slip and slide, make you wanna dip and dive
Tripping while we rip and ride, 'til I get you to cum inside
Got you where I want yo' ass
In the case of an emergency, break the glass
Keep yo eyes on the present and erase the past
And be happy if we got mo' blunts to pass
Get done up and run up
In the guts 'til yo' butt don't shake like it used to
I wake 'em up like a rooster
Take it slow, not faster than a turbo booster
No worry, no hurry - no pain, no gain
Better keep yo' eyes on strain
Cause ain't a damn thing changed, mayn
Sit back, relax and just take off yo shoes

Dickie shorts and lincoln's clean, leaning checking out the scene
Gangsta boys bligga's lit, riding out talking shit
Nigga where you wanna go, you know the club don't close til four
Let's party til we can't no more, watch out here come the folks

As the plot thickens it gives me the dickens
Reminiscent of charles, a lil' disco-tech nestled in the ghettos
Of Niggaville, USA via Atlanta, Georgia, a lil' spot where
Young men and young women go to experience they first lil'

Taste of nightlife, me? Well, I've never been there, well perhaps once
But I was so engulfed in the ""E""
I never made it to the door you speak of hard core
While the dj sweating out all the problems and troubles of the day

While this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors
Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with ""set it off"" in the right
But it all blends perfectly, let the liquor tell it

""Hey, hey look baby, they playin' our song""
And the crowd goes wild as if holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality it's only about 3 am
And three niggas just done got hauled off in the ambulance (sliced up)

Two niggas done start bustin' (wham, wham)
And one nigga done took his shirt off talkin' bout
""Now who else wanna fuck with hollywood cold?""
It's just my interpretation of the situation

Damn, damn, damn James

When I first met my spottieottiedopaliscious angel
I can remember that damn thang like yesterday
The way she moved remined me of a brown stallion horse with skates on
Smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair

I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter than a plate of yams with extra syrap
Eyes beaming like four carats apiece just blinding a nigga
Felt like i chiefed a whole ""O"" of that presidential

My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes (ya dig)
One moment you frequent the booty clubs and the next four years

You and somebody's daughter rising y'all own young'n
Now that's a beautiful thang, that's if you're on top of your game
And man enough to handle real life situations (that is)
Can't gamble feeding baby on that dope money

Might not always be sufficient, but the United Parcel Service
And the people at the post office, didn't call you back because you got
Cloudy piss, so now you back in the trap just that, trapped
Go and marinate on that for a minute",Musixmatch

I guess I gotta hide away, far away
Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
Ay-ay-ay ay-ay-ay aaay

I left out from mama's with my thumb in the wind
The leaves on the ground, winter's comin again
Solid on the surface as I crumble within
But legends are made out of vulnerable men
So on the brink of death I still manage livin life
Cause so rarely in this world are these chances given twice
I indeed sold my soul, without glancing at the price
No instructions when I was handed this device
But with what I did get, I was more than generous
Put others over self on several instances
But I'm back on my feet without a hint of bitterness
And one way or another I shall have deliverance
So I say

I've been travelin for some time {*echoes*}
With my fishin pole and my bottle of shine {*echoes*}
On these long dark dusty roads {*echoes*}
Lookin there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
Ay-ay-ay ay-ay-ay aaay

Can you recall a time people loved you unconditionally?
Toast in the new south, this one is for history
Then I slipped fell and caused the number's injury
Called the same people and it's yo you just missed them be
This the formula, dammit Bubba you had it
Why'd you have to keep it Polo and New Balance?
Then they start to question whether you a true talent
Or just a redneck substance abuse addict
So then you hide away just to try to find your way
And now they back to callin you 200 times a day
I want all y'all to know, good or bad I'll remember it
And 10 million sold in the name of my deliverance

I've been travelin for some time {*echoes*}
With my fishin pole and my bottle of shine {*echoes*}
On these long dark dusty roads {*echoes*}
Lookin there's nowhere to go

Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
Ay-ay-ay ay-ay-ay aaay

Nothing could atone for the pain you've endured
The blood you shed is still stainin your velour
You took your wealth and knowledge and gave it to the poor
Only to discover that your savior's manure
Accepted me as kin, put before your younger brother
They put a lot on us hardly knowin one another
I honestly can say that over time I've come to love you
Now we are brothers and together no one can touch us
It hauls me with regret I never met your baby girl
She's an angel on your shoulder helpin us to save the world
This musical marriage is no coincedence
On my mama Timmy baby we shall have deliverance
So we say

This road you travel will seem like nowhere
But nowhere will turn into somewhere
Keep your head up bubba, dont let nobody get ya down
Cause that road you travel will turn around
Ive accepted every challenge and risen to all occasions
A country boy that got them most like randy, mos, and jason
Perhaps old bubbas new rules dont fit in ya'lls equation
If your opinion coincides with that you ought to save them
Cuz to quote the greatest southern rapper, fuckin' period
Negative spirits, they only keep you down a myriad
Of satan selflessness, and my sister steal my wisdom
Is never once compromised, thats between god and i
Never once forgotten my manners cuz my mamma
Played in public housing, be polite in alabama
But she had a different plan for me and russ and ginger
Thank the lord for jimmy mathis, pop sing must remember
Cuz he stuck around when them other clowns disappeared
Showed me how to set the scope, shoot, and leave with the deer
And then he made me drink the blood to show me life was precious
The money rolled from nowhere to somewhere, here's my directions

I know what its like to be nowhere
I know what its like
I know what its like to be nowhere

Or writing santa claus, i guess he got the list too late
Or to catch the fish you bait the hook with little dillans poopoo

Now I just wonder if he know he close to bein' replaced
Swear I treat u like a queen u put me in his place
So you could give back his ring and the key to his place

Tell the nigga one thing that u need ya space
Tell the niggas one thing u don?t need to chase
I wanna kiss u everywhere between ya knees and waist
Hear the sounds that u make and get ya knees to shake

Holla at me in the A you feel u need to escape
Got a mansion and a gate, you wit me and you safe

600 g's in the safe how much cheese it take

This a chance u need to take it ain't no need to wait
Say the word we can leave today it's somethin' special and it feel like fate
Hate to make a mistake
How the same thing makin' ya sad makin' ya stay

Can he touch it like that and make it feel like this
How he left and came back and it's still like this
Do he hit it from the back and make u feel it in ya chest
Take advantage of what you concealin' in ya dress

What he think he too fresh to show u that u the best
Compliment u on ya intellect and treat u wit respect
Make u sex till u sweat tongue kissin' on ya neck
It's been a while since u got it like this I bet

And I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this not yet
Know u confused ain't decided which way you should go yet

You thinkin' about the beatin', this my ends is never met
Black man, white man, Jew man, ain't no joke
Remember me and my cousin used to sit up on the porch
And talk about when we get older, now we up against the ropes
Yeah, they kickin' door down, 'cause it ain't no dope on the streets

And a quarter pound of feet weed, that's all a like me need
Talkin' about that Southern sess, you all up in that mess
But never shall you test, and never shall you quit
Runnin' up on me with that- will get you nothin' but dead

Be careful where you roam 'cause you might not make it home

Don't you dare ever get lost or get caught up in that sauce

Right up they sleeve you won't believe they deceive like weave
Thieves can't break in your crib and leave in that good life too
So gimme me and then I'm straight, as eight-oh-five
See, blindfolds can't cover three eyes
We wise to the fact so we attack with what we know
Heaven is the only good life, so what you strivin' fo'?

So what mo' can you come wit'?
Yeah, they can bite, but cannot be us
They can come and pick up little slang but cannot see us
You ought to be ashamed, trying to fit in my adidas
So Run like D.M.C. is me and, no, don't got no heater
Well, we zippin' around the corner in that golden stankin' Lincoln
I got my heat up under my seat
Just in case these youngsters tryin' to take it
Pullin' the pistol on another black man was never the plot
But sometimes my brothers lose theyself and try to take my spot
They come like black stallions in the night
Usually around fo' or five is when they figure the time is right

It's him and I, Aquemini

Yeah

Now is the time to get on like Spike Lee said
""Get on the bus"", go get your work
And keep your beeper chirpin' is a must
Is you on that dust or cornstarch
Familiar with that smack man
The music is like that green stuff
Provided to you by sack man
Pacman how in the fuck do you think we gon' do that, man?
Ridin' round Old National on eighteens without no gat, man
I'm strapped man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times
And swung hard when it was fittin'
But now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners
That we be bendin' in Volkswagens and Bonnevilles
Chevrolets and Coupe De Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga don't get no wood grain
Steerin' wheel for real (real), you can go on chill out and still build

Nothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain and nothin' lasts forever

Twice upon a time there was a boy who died
And lived happily ever after but that's another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
Beauty parlors and baby bottles and bowlin' ball Impalas
And street scholars majorin' in culinary arts
You know how to work bread cheese and dough
From scratch but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya sellin', what ya bought, so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge, meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin' bad, need some hope
Like the words ""maybe"", ""if"", or ""probably""
More than a hobby when my turntables get wobbly they don't fall
I'm sorry y'all, I often drift I'm talkin' gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside it's grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but it's needed so what have you?
Now question is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw
So don't get caught up in appearance
It's Outkast, Aquemini another Black experience

Okay

Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes, ""Y""
Nothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I, Aquemini

The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax
The nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets
'Cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that some say we pro-black, but we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nut sacks
You bust a rhyme we bust back
G-Get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts
You hear that can't come near that, maybe you need to quit (quit)
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and a Gemini runnin' shit like this (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

My mind warps and bends floats the wind count to ten
Meet the twin Andre Ben', welcome to the lion's den
Original skin, many men comprehend
I extend myself, so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believin' in
Faith is what you make it, that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in wit' yo' kin
Look again 'cause I swear I spot one every now and then
It's happenin' again wish I could tell you when
""Andre this is Andre, y'all just gon' have to make amends""

To make his whole crew believers you're harder than a bitch full of dicks
But that don't be sounding like he's shit to me
See now in the ghetto or should I say Lakewood
You better be strapped 'cause them niggas over there just ain't good
Just being a hustler, serving on all your customers
Rent was due on the 1st of the month so I'm hustling
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo
And niggas be wanting drinks and shit from the fucking sto', yo
But that's alright, tho', 'cause I be getting paid

I'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five

Niggas I used to hang wit wants to act like they don't know me
Come and listen to my story, I gots a lot of shit up on my mind
I wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish your behind
Take a number, I caught you in a slumber
I hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer
But now it's the fall, I'm having a ball, making my nickels act strong

I got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane

From being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous

If you want to battle, it's either that you will or you won't
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
If you got some fly shit, yo, niggas gonna how we tote
Dope, is not what I be slanging on this track
Niggas don't comprehend that it be deeper that Cadillacs
You know that, right, you bite, you fucked up
You won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up

And since I got time, what I'm gonna do?
Is tell you how it's spreaded throughout my crew
Well you all know Nate Dogg who sings on my records
""Never Leave Me Alone"", ""Ain't No Fun"", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg began
He used to try to holla at this girl named Pam
The type of female with fly Gucci wear
She wore a big Turkish wool with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talkin' about, ""Baby, please, you out here servin' stress""
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he rock boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus coupe that's extra G
And now she stop frontin' and wants to speak and
Be comin' around The Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number, she be beggin' please (please)
Dyin' for the day to eat these

She caught the vapors (vapors)

He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow, that's laid back
But back in the days he wasn't nothin' like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hangin' down with his Starks untied
And a blue and gray cap that said ""The Eastside""
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
They said, "" Daz was the worst thing his moms ever had""
They said, ""He he would grow up to be nothin' but a gangsta""
Or either in jail or someone will shank him
But now he's grown up to they're surprise
D-a-z, he got a hit record slangin' world wide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bumpin' Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle

They caught the vapors (the vapors, vapors)

I got another homie from the LBC
Known to y'all as DJ Warren G
He cut, scratched, transformed with finesse
And all that mess
I remember when we first started to rap
He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted
Said, ""Sorry Warren G, but there's no help wanted""
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on 'til the light break of dawn
To work at the V.I.P. Would be the link
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is havin' papers so my homie's life straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like, ""Warren, welcome to my store""
Offerin' him a job, but nah, he don't want it (man)
Damn, it feels good to see people up on it
'Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught since he bustin'?

They caught the vapors (the vapors)
(Now-now guess what they caught?)
Guess I gotta talk about me, now (the vapors)

Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager, I tried to be down
But since they wasn't tryna hear me, I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street
And said, ""Can I be down, champ?""
They said, ""No"", they treated me like a wet food stamp
After gettin' rejected, I ain't run off the set
I sat and wrote some Dogg doodle rhymes at my rest
When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight
I ain't never love no hoes, I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep on hangin' with the Deuces
But now things switched from West to East
""Yo Dogg, do you remember me from 21st street, G?"" (Sorry, I don't)
""We used to see Daz back in the day""
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed

Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through, they run and duck
We still right here, so what the fuck?

So what you saying? (What you saying is you-)
Man, what you say, you need to get the fuck out of my business nigga
That's what you need to do

Every time I'm doing something

640,Forgot About Dre,Dr. Dre,"Y'all know me, still the same O.G.
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese
No deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop, or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all
If y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me
And turn me back to the old me

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walking by with a Walkman on
When I caught a guy, gave me an awkward eye (What you looking at?)
I strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs, trying to walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here)
So from here on out, it's The Chronic II
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Slim Shady, hotter then a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80's
Calling men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him Hailie (Dada?)

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

If it was up to me
You motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
With your hands out looking up to me
Like you want something free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumping me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of Compton (Compton)
I told 'em all
All them little gangsters, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talking bout guns, like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all?
'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish

Yo! Yeah!

Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally, got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up fo' later as I hit the do'
Thinkin', ""Will I live another 24'?""

I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop, at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight

And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies, and I'm askin' y'all
Which park, are y'all playin' basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe, today was a good day, shit!

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from them cowards
'Cause just yesterday, them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police, and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?

Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em!
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas, and watch me break 'em
Wit' the seven, 7-11, 7-11
Seven, even back do' Lil Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin' ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day, shit!

Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on her big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep, so deep
Put her ass to sleep

Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off, and then chirped out

Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the mornin', got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, ""Ice Cube's a Pimp!"" (yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home, and my pager's still blowin' up
Today, I didn't even have to use my AK

Y'all from San Francisco right?
Nah G we show alot of love
But in the state of California from Humboldt to Oceanside ya dig
But L.A. is where it all happens for the Dub and Thes One
All you MC's say L.A. when you on stage
And when you do spit that hot verse
We gonna make it happen man

Who wanna test?
We lickin' off shots in the west
We make believers out the best
Lay the weak to rest
In southern California ain't no place like this
Half the stuff y'all doin' we created this shit
So don't be saggin young buck in the presence of this
Don't even come from the city and your runnin your lips
I'm 'bout to make a call get the news van out
Explain to Tritia Toyota on how your crew ran out
We comin live from the trey two three area code
Mad clouds of smoke and ain't no room for snow
Sucka niggas with sucka beats
Stay in the back seat and buckle up for the ride
I'm chillen with bad guys
And got time on my side
Cause this is my city this is where I live
And if ya bring bad vibes I got something to give
Hangin out under the sun is an everyday thang
And gettin crazy in the labs the only way I bang
Don't step to me with that mean face
Buddy I'm all smiles and I'm countin the miles
Down Crescent Heights boulevard
Home of the stars
Get ya pulled out ya car for frontin' too hard
Just listen, you ain't down with the streets my brotha?
I can forsee in your future ther'es some runnin for cover
Alot of y'all talk a good game
But ain't playin
I learned about the hood and now feel thats where your stayin
Fools be givin you the mad dog after the show
Cause we ain't feelin them flows
Or your designer clothes
Its phony people in L.A. I counted its alot
And if the hanus catch your a bully there claimin your block
Just get it right its Crescent Heights all day all night
The community where I was raised
Livin my days
Wishin I could be the mayor i'd deport you fools
And send you back to squareland cause over here we brew
Authentic people in the town
Throw up your dub take a drag
It's Double K signin off from the home of the bodybags

Yo about five years after they kill
Creep up the hipe
Wrestlee moovahs the sleepers
Drugdealers rock beepers
T tops, jerry curls, jelly flip flops for girls
C.B.'s on the strip and a commercial for
World on Wheels I whistle to my crew up on the block
The Color soundtrack rock the Fatburger jukebox
My L.A. U.S.C. memories are every sticks who filed down clowns
Claimin the same tricks on this turf
My roots go deep like turbo Nerf
And the cops still sweat us
I roll on all blocks like I'm sellin paletas
And rock the bells
Home of the drive-by where they pop the shells
I eat at Charro's and La Barca, not Taco Bell
And if your not from the city then you should probably bail
Cause alot of cats are implants
Claimin our labels something to say and something to prove and
At the shows with the flows and they think the crowds groovin
Its like the 405 at 5:30 nobodys movin
I'm tired of non-recognition losin the mission to proven to cats
That my soundtracks and L.A. hat
When newjacks strap New York rap on the block
With a palm tree it makes me sick
All you underground producers get off Premier's dick and just (chill)
I'm headed back to Pedro to sit up on the hill
Next to the Korean bell eatin Busy Bee
Watchin waves swell high visibility Catalina and sail boats
Hollywood hip hop soaps and sit-com dreams
I make morphine for beat fiends
Support L.A. teens stay trippin with Cal Green
O.G. Jerry Duffey when I'm on your screen
I'm friends with neighborhood crack heads
And I know (?Ben?)
L.A. is the place where I solve my problems
In it i'll never fear
I'll always stay here

We can work it out, we gon work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now

We live and we learn, we crash and we burn
Right now my only rhyme is this lesson I learned
You talk about trust, I talk about lust
Its not appealin as you truly speak your feelings
I be lookin at the ceiling, so concealing
I shoulda put my heart on the table
Knowin I was good and able but instead I fed your fables
If I could have you back best believe it'd be forever
Cause each and every day you would hear those four letters

These are different times but we feel the same pains
The blood of mankind runnin through the same veins
We'd like to make it right some which it remain tame
Same crimes even though they names changed
And we like different minds workin off the same brain
Passengers on different cars steppin off the same train
In the end, makin it rights the main aim
Different parts of the picture highlight the same frame

Now if you know what I know you need to work it out (work it out)
If you ain't happy with yourself you need to work it out (work it out)
You havin problems with your family then work it
The things we go through just to work it
I work it out when the situations seems unworkable
Unreversible but God is most merciful
Many works, Many men converse
With soul search sweat it out
When they tryin to work it out

With the constant complaint, we either gonna make it fly
Or we ain't, I already know what some of ya think
Ima talk a hip hop and how bad its got
Then tryna pull a brother, I'm not
Lookin for nobody to judge
You said you ain't I never thought you was
I'm just tryna get with ya and pose in the same picture
So this mic thing can move the right thing do the right thing
Made for your life game, plus my man might sing

These are different times but we feel the same pains

We'd like to make it right some which it remain tame

And we like different minds workin off the same brain
Passengers on different cars steppin off the same train

Hell nah we don't surf, We half way go to church,
Tell you the truth, shit, right now I'm in the fuckin' hearse,
And it ain't my night to get buried in the dirt
But it is your day to get buried by a verse,
It'll be another ten years before you see an MC Ren here,
Where he been, I been there, that Lambo, I'm in there,
Hotter then the beginning of my career with 50, Dre and Em there,
Top off the Murcialago like Victoria's Secret swim swear,
So listen, I'm so sincere, bout to work out like gym wear,
Murder MTV's top ten, and tat my face with 10 tears,
That's 10 funerals, 10 caskets,
10 3-piece Ralph Lauren suits, 10 motorbikes stopping traffic,
And 10 reasons why I got California hotter than acid,
Don't you ever, ever leave me out of the top 10 you fuckin' bastards

The remix version for all the brothers out there
That got shit on they chest and just wanna let it out

Anything you could do I could do fresher
When I'm on the microphone I rock the shit without no pressure
Cause I snuck my forty ouncer past the bouncer with the stun gun
I gots to get some lyrics off my chest so let me run one
Cause who's bad? not Michael Jackson when I asked him
I even rock the mic for seven days with Toni Braxton
It's the, liks, rockin' like a six point six
So while I be scoopin' bitches you rush the porno flicks

For reals, I gots more skills than an occupation center
I got your hoe cookin' my dinner
Action, lights and cameras ain't needed
Indeed it's, the nigga that be gettin' rappers heated
I'm j-ro, and my style is darker than a mole
My rhyme is so hot you got to stop drop and roll
All the liks releases, become masterpieces
Oh jeezus, my style is sick like pork greases

And I can't hold it in (I can't hold it in)
I gotta let it all out (I gotta let it all out)
They'll say I can't hold it in (I can't hold it in)

I gotta let it all out (I gotta let it all out)
They'll say I can't hold it in (I can't hold it in)
I gotta, I gotta let it all out

I get in 'em when I sin 'em, the alkaholik venom
I fold your clothes with your body still in 'em
The rhymes I got, hit like Ronnie Lott
The only way you take my spot is with a shot
I grab rappers by the hand and make sure they understand
That they can't scrape j-ro the man
A nigga who stays, in the old school ways
And just like subways, I can make your days
We got more soul than james brown and platform adidas
The likwit crew, comin' new like a fetus
So run tell your granny, your pops and your girl
niggas like me gonna rule the world
So all aboard the j-ro train to funkytown
Express from the west so it's best that I clown

I bust the alehze on ice on down to beck's brew
I got more fame than dana dane I hold mics like Donahue
Cause I'm committed, admit it, you was too legit to quit it
Dancin' with toilets now you can't get busy with it
With the vintage olde gold gettin' dusty in the cellar
I throw my shit deeper than Jeff Hostettler
So yo what you got, 'cause God damn it's hot
It's the alkaholik rhymer up in your night spot
So ease up off my line, and let me rhyme
I lose you like the jewelry that that bitch can't find
Call me e.t., but yo, it don't take a secret psychic
Cause even in the future i'ma frak it when I mic it

And I can't hold it in (I can't hold it in)
I gotta let it all out (I gotta let it all out)
They'll say I can't hold it in (I can't hold it in)
I gotta let it all out (I gotta let it all out)

With flows rough enough to cut ya, beats enough to touch ya
Known to rock the cooles with the liquid rhyme structures
It's the man with vocal tones that hurt words to broken bones
I got flows throughout my body deep rooted like kidney stones
So tap into the cold while I torch mc's
Cause I be itchin for a scratch like the force md's
But yo fuck that, tash is in the wind with the gin
I gotta pass the mic to j 'cause he can't hold it in

I can't hold it in my friend the liks get the most clout
We be scorin points like michael irvin on the post route
And just like joi boy, I make your bones ache man
Just how much punishment can a rapper take man?
The homes be like where you been? man I been creatin
We had you salivation like the dogs that be waitin
For the kibbles 'n' bits, I love pits tits and rap hits
And Bruce Lee flicks, and clockin yapes with the liks

I can't hold it in I gotta speak my mind
There's a lotta half-ass niggas thinkin' they can rhyme
But their style is not buttah, it's more like busta without the a
You never think of nothin' fresh to say
The freshest dj from the state of ohio

Who want to be large and forget who we are

Asphalt, they incinerate cause we came
Not to destroy the law but to fulfill
For those who appreciate those with skills
And fresh windmills, and graf that kills
What is a DJ without the scratch to build?
Without the elements, it's all irrelevant
Niggas love to Freestyle but hate to Fellowship

Yeah, taste the city's agenda, most of you outta town niggas
Get caught up and turn bitter, the city of bullshitters
Where hopes are blown, not even money for the phone
Now tell me what's the solution, how to get back home?

Yo, don't get caught up in glamor and glitz and camera tricks
The Land of the Dead, before you come examine your set
Where drama collects and women use special effects
Where amateur stunts can make a nigga damage your fronts

Uh, the California Sunkist with a twist of limelight
Some set trip on the Sunset Strip
Belive the Hide Boulevard nice, the glamorous life
Many searching for the fame but can't afford the price

She would turn you out if you wasn't prepared
She would tell you the things you wanted to hear
She would blur your vision when it once was clear
This chick is full of tricks so approach with fear, cause

Yo, we are no superstars
Who want to be large and forget who we are
Don't judge us by bank accounts and big cars
No matter how bright we shine we're far from being stars

You say you love LA, you say the weather is great
Plenty sun in your face, you like the cars with bass
You like the way we paper chase and the women that shake
In the land of earthquakes and high crime rates
A lot of people is fake, this is Hollywood
We shape the minds of kids in every hood
We make your past situation look good
The nights filled with Shugs and I wish you would

Can dance with Alvin Haley and Les Miserables
In this century city, you can walk on the stars
Sex, money, and murder, yeah it's all 4 to 5
Cause fame and passerby with the name immortalized

On the avenue of stars, many names are called
On the boulevard, known for leaving permanent scars
Many dreams get robbed, real movie macabre
Young heartthrobs get young heart sobs, cause

""Good evenening ladies and gentlemen welcome to Hollywood, California""

The city of angel's wings represents people's hopes and dreams
And the evil that men do that live life close to kings
And boast supreme, fancy cars, coats, and cream
Material things provoke more folks to scheme
Whether you paid your cost, Cali green made your call
The smog covers the city like a table cloth
Is it fame at fault? Entertainers labeled soft
The place where people come to lose their train of thought

Despite the claims of what LA is and what it ain't
The picture the city paints that over exaggerates
Within the circus, if you're filling this service purpose
Some feel it ain't worth it, the city that's got you nervous
And make you injure, and get up out of here nigga
Cause LA never considered for those that need baby sitters
This is the hot bed for singles and newlyweds
Some looking for better gigs or fiending to make it big
It's the only place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn
Out, by any place regardless of the cost
Cause brothers with big dreams, sometimes they get lost cause

Yo, we are no superstars
Who want to be large and forget who we are
Don't judge us by bank accounts and big cars
No matter how bright we shine we're far from being stars

Why does a nigga try, I can't do the right thing
Only God knows what the future might bring
Nigga might be shive, nigga might be triflin'
Nigga might survive if he bout that rifling
Whats up that'll stop a nigga from playin'
Something like a chopper or a grenade in his hand
Boy look nigga don't play no games no mo
Nigga'll bust ya head if you bang his ho
Attitude adjustments we all need
Don't call the enforcements nigga call me
I bet cha I'll get them niggas off yo block
I bet cha I'll show them niggas this boy hot

Man let me get this beef shit over bruh
Ain't no bit this year I'm from the 'Nolia bruh
Whats yo beef plan 'cause it was told to us
How I'mma be runnin' with these killas and backin' down
How I'mma look in front of my people, like a clown
Tha G code what we live by and we die by
The book is what we will never abide by
Niggas drive by, gettin' loose
Beefing with each other like the Checker Board and Goose
Come in Compton or the Watts nigga
Up in New York ya keep'em open watch nigga
Foe ya played by a hit or retalion
All fine young black females stallions
Give me the keys to ya car and ya medallion
You far away from ya home you's an alien

664,Mr. ScarfaceScarfaceMr. Scarface Is Back1991Hip-Hop/Rap,Scarface,"Mr. Mr. Scarface from walking down the block
Out jumps some fiends and steals all his rocks
Pulls out a gun and shoots down all the fiends
And Mr. Mr. Scarface went up the block again

Ah yeah, hah
Mr. Scarface is back in the motherfuckin house once again!
Yea droppin some of that new
Mr. scarface two, on your motherfuckin ass
So suck a nigga dick, or make a nigga rich
Or something

I don't give a fuck about the chatter in the background
Niggas get beat when they step this is axe down
If you don't know, I recommend you check
And ask them motherfuckers, how many heads I put to rest

I play a game but the game ain't roulette
Slangin cane is the thang and I beat
That there's a lot of wannabe scarfaces
I've heard the name in ninety-nine different places

I'm here to squash it all original will speak
Scarface on your ass from the streets
I left my cut, in fear of a prison term
They wanna put me in a chair and let me burn

But go to prison on a murder rap, fuck that
I refuse to be a visitor in state's camp
So I broke and left behind all I worked for
Either that or be sentenced for a drug war

And many want to know why I've slowed up
It's either that or get fucked
Cause laws get happy on the trigger
Say fuck it put a cap in a nigga

But this ass ain't made for no caps homey
This ass says ""exit only""
So I get in the wind but hey
A nigga still sold a quarter everyday

I sat around for six months black
Waitin for the day to make a comeback
And now I'm ready for combat
Mr. Scarface is back

Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
On the farilla my nigga just call me Scarface

Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
On the farilla my nigga just call me scarface

Aiyyo bido, drop that shit
Yeah, heh heh heh

Back in the south park, six o'clock on the dot
Checkin on my old rock spot
I seen the same old set
Heh, the small timers see me so they jet

Buildin one-twenty-eight
I got myself a bag and I can't wait
To cut em up small to make a profit
Niggas on the cut short stop it

Fiends'll see em small then they go
Where, to see the motherfuckin pro
One nigga got pissed
And started reachin for his shit

Three-fifty-seven on your ass fool
Like I said before, you don't get a second chance dude
Unloaded on his ass he was hurt
Six shots put his dick in the dirt

Laid him out like a motherfuckin rug
Gettin pumped full of thirty-eight slugs
Some other niggas stepped out y'all
Aww shit, I had to make a phone call

Hello?
Hay jay
Whassup?
I'm in a little trouble man
Where you at?
I'm out here in south park village
Stay right there, I'll be right on
C'mon let's take these motherfucers to war main

Jay called up some niggas from the 5th ward
And came back with a motherfuckin hit squad
Motherfuckin uzi machine
Big chief packed an m-16

Will and ak with a banana clip
And little bill had a god damn pistol grip
I hit a little laugh and got me a buzz
And that's about the time they got drugged
One more war took place
You can call me the shit started, or call me Mr. Scarface

Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
On the farilla my nigga just call me Scarface

Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
On the farilla my nigga just call me Scarface

Damn, check this shit out

Later on, all alone, you know what happened next
Another bitch came by to give me sex
It was kind of strange I was thrown off
The last bitch got her head blown off

But fuck I ain'tsta pass up no pooty
She started strippin at the door, oh goody
I got in that ass with the quickness
Fuckin her down with the diznick

I didn't have to pretend I loved her
All she wanted me to do was just fuck her
So i gave it up to the lady
And all she said was ""fuck me baby, fuck me baby""

I started stroking in an outrage
The whole while I was starin at my twelve gauge
The bitch was makin noise I said I'm killin her
And all the while my dick was hard and he was still in her

I made a nut as she fell to the floor
I heard a knock on the front door
I grabbed the twelve gauge from the bed head

Who is it? (Fred) who?
Who the fuck is fred?

I stood by the door
By that time someone jumped in the window
Now what the fuck was I do?
The bitch packed a twenty-two

Hit him in his head, there she laid him
The nigga standin by the door I sprayed him
And headed for the back
I seen that same old brown cadillac
It kinda fucked me up at first
Cause the nigga that drove that caddy rode away in a hearse

I opened up fire on the ride g
Who i was shootin for was standin right behind me
I had a double barrel pointed at my ass
Could this be the end of Mr. Bread?

I don't know what happened to the slut
Well that's about the time the closet door it opened up
On your ass trick!
I'll be damned if I go out like the last bitch

Heh, five-oh's on my ass main
They know me by the face, but they don't know my last name
Now i'm back on the case
Yeah, just call me Mr. Scarface",Musixmatch

You be hatin' and I see why
'Cause you don't know me

I think its time I made a song fo niggas who don't know me
I graduated at the streets, I'ma real OG
I been trappin' shootin' pistols since I stood on both feet
So while you niggas actin bad, you gon have to show me
You gone make me bring a chevy to a real slow creek
My niggas hangin' out the window, mouth fulla gold teeth
When the guns start poppin', wonder when its gonna cease
Chopper hitchu on the side and create a slow leak
We been in the speculation 'cause today we gone see
What's the future of a pussy nigga hatin' on me
I giva fuck about the feds investigation on me
I don't care they at my shows and they waitin' on me
I'ma keep a flossy poppin' long as to is on the beat
Tell police that I ain't stoppin' I'ma keep it in the streets
Contrary to yo believes, I'm as real as you can be
Fuck yo thoughts and yo feelings nigga you don't know me

Homies holdin' up the doe, 'cause they know we tote heat
I just wanna wrap a C, blow a dro ina flee
Only playin' bout a dozen different pictures in a week
I just wanna chill with country and his daddy Freddy G
Ballin' out every time, every stone is but a G
Wanna ball in the Bahamas courtesy of KT
Fact I only gotta Mill, as well as a dolla DP
Ak house on the hill right next to JG
Every week be there for lunch, busta blunt and eat free
Get in day paid Lil Craig dead meat
That's the only shot we got at gettin' cap back on the streets

You can bring your whole posse, bitch, I still won't lose

Snap and served you crackers trippin' and heard you

675,Diary Of A MadmanScarfaceMr. Scarface Is Back1991Hip-Hop/Rap,Scarface,"Yo anybody seen my diary?
Oh, there it is
I gotta write this shit down
Check it out

Dear Diary, I'm having a little problem
I can't make it by myself, maybe you can help me solve 'em
I'm confused and I don't know what to do
I'm hoping you can help me, 'cause there's no one else to talk to

I want to die, but it ain't for me
I try to talk to my dad, but my old man ignores me
He says I'm delirious
And I drink too much, so he doesn't take me serious

But little does he know I'm really losing it
I got a head, but ain't no screws in it
I be thinking deep
That's one of the reasons at night I can't sleep

I thought it would change when I was older
But even now I'm still peeping over my shoulder
There's your life after death too
And what about the man with the cane and the black suit?

And what about cancer?
Too many motherfucking questions, and not enough answers
Ain't no use in trying
We might as all face it, we were all born dying
There's a black book in Brad's hands
And it's the diary of a madman

Dear diary, today I hit a nigga with a torch
Shot him on his face and watched him die on his front porch
Left his family heartbroken
Flashbacks of him laying there bleeding with his eyes open

I can't put the shit behind me
I'm know I'm here somewhere, but I can't find me
I used to be a drug dealer
On the for reala, now I'm a born killer

And it ain't no changing me
It used to be hard, but now it ain't nothing to me
To go up to a niggas house
Put a pistol in his mouth, and blow his fucking brains out

No doubt if you cross then I'ma take ya
'Cause I'm a fucking killer by nature
You got an M11, bring your weapon
Huh, I got an AK-47

It's gonna be a bloody Sunday
'Cause your fucking with a nigga like Bundy
And I was taught not to kill
Like a Vietnam vet with a thousand-yard stare

So welcome to the slaughterhouse nigga
Red rum and I'ma be the grave digger
And if you want to cap, come cap me
I'm trigger-happy like my great-grandpappy

Just watch for the chrome in my right hand
My second entry from the diary of a madman

Dear diary, help me 'cause I'm frantic
Sometimes I think I'm going schizophrenic
The world's looking dark for instance
Maybe 'cause I'm looking from a distance

But then again I wear a blindfold
Staring at the motherfucking world with my eyes closed
To myself, I'm a stranger
Walking in the footsteps of danger

It's a long path ahead of me
I gotta get somewhere 'cause everybody here is scared of me
I had a job, but they fired me

Didn't worry about no static I had a motherfuckin pump
Ass out of line, word em up a nigga sprayed em

He helped me for a minute then he started screwin up
Said fuck gettin paid, I guess my brother'd rather fuck
Bitches ran his life, and they're still runnin Lee
I guess he doesn't realize the bitch is fuckin me
It really doesn't matter, cause Ac'll never tell
He can stay broke, but I got dope to sell
I step out on the cut, shit was lookin funny
I ran back in the house and started callin up my money
I signaled for my workers, to bring in all the dope
I can feel the bust and sure enough in comes the 5-0
Niggaz stayed relaxed but they was friskin niggaz up
If someone said my name then I was definitely fucked
But I'ma play it cool, if I kill I gotta kill
Fightin for my shit, I never ran and never will
Come to find out, they wasn't fuckin with my boys
Busted a nigga who said he paid em, talkin noise

I never had the nuts to make the motherfucking final cut
I've been depressed for no fucking reason

My homies tend to think I get too high
I'm doing fine, now pass me the formaldehyde
The only thing that seems to help me cope
Is when I'm drunker than a motherfucker puffin' on the chronic smoke
And then I'm able to deal with the woes
The friends, the foes, the bitches, the hoes
I gotta gang of niggas, but none of them I'd fuck
I gotta gang of bitches, but none of them I'd trust
Trust a bitch, nope, uh-uh, never
I'm havin' too much trouble tryin' to keep my damn self together
They got me by the balls
So please, help me break these motherfucking...
These motherfucking walls

I scream, there's no one there to hear me cry
I guess its hard to scream to motherfuckers when you scream inside
I see my future and its coming in in plain view
I blame myself, but mommy dear I blame you
Cause the world was fucked from the first
And havin' me only made the matters worse
Now look at what they did to me
That's some fucked up shit for a kid to see
Motherfucking dealin' after dealin', killin' after killin'
I'm tryin' to check a million
The world's going straight to fuckin satan
A fucking shank's about to blow my fuckin' brain

Shit, damn I'm dead
I'm finally through hearing all these voices in my head
Somebody finally got me
I'm looking at my self outside of my fucking body
So now I'm standing face to face
Mr. Scarface, versus Mr. Scarface
We were two different people from the start
One nigga's too smart the other too fucking hard
We both refused to be outsmarted
Dearly departed, the battle's already started
Fuck it, its on, I duck, I weave, connect, oh shit, I'm struck
Caught me with the piercing lead
And realized to myself I shot my own fucking self
Damn, suicide is quicker
I try to break the wall the wall keeps getting thicker
I really start to miss my mother
I try to climb the wall, its higher than a motherfucker
I wondering what that sound is
I'm having major trouble trying to walk around it
There ain't no getting up I'm trapped
I really should've dropped my motherfucking strap
Cause when I think about it now
I shouldn't have tried to climb the motherfucker

A new day  brings a new problem to a brother
And all I gots ta say is thank god for my mother
Cause without my mommy dear my life would've been joke
Either locked up playin' dead and still slangin' dope but nope
The lord he had a plan for me
And with his help  my mother made a man of me
Didn't blindfold me to the world we was livin' in
Taught me how to save my little dividends
So when I graduated I'd have a little school money
But in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy
And flunked outta school with the flag pole
And left my mother dear at home with a sad soul
Because my mother worked the fingers to the bone
Cause we was alone, and me I bought a death home
My real pops he broke out with the style
So I respect my step dad, for raisin' another nigga's child
So now we livin' comftable
Taught me the game and how to be responsible
But back then I couldn't see it
I wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kid's leavin'
And ended up in a big fight
And told me not to come home until I got my shit right
So now I'm livin' in my grandma's home
My grandma's strong, she's got nine kids of her own
And keepin' me ain't no big deal
But now that I'm much older I see just how the shit feels
Being kind-hearted, not wantin' to tell me no
Even though my grandfather just had a stroke
And now the money's low
And pretty soon a brother's gonna have ta go
Or either try to find a job so I can help out
I'm in the ghetto, I gots ta get myself out
And when I get out I gotta try to pave the way
So my family can have a better place to stay
I'm losin' all hope, a brother's fallin' short
I can't cope, so now I'm slangin' dope
And now my granny knows I'm doin' wrong
She just prayin' for me heavily
Take care of her grandson
And the lord must of heard her prayer
Cause he made me get a grip
And got me on up outta there
I heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then
But now I feel ya

I'm eighteen, and now I'm havin' big fun
My baby's mother just had my first son
May eleven, I never will forget the day
A star's born, let's name him little Scarface
My first born and yo I'm a proud father
I gotta son, I gots ta be my son's father
And selling dope ain't the way that I can get ahead
But what the hell, I gots ta keep my baby fed
I buy him milk, and pampers trying ta do my part
And he's my son, I gots ta try to make him hard
I buy him clothes, and jewelry not the Tonka toys
Because the Tonka toys will only punk my boy
And I don't want my son to look at life
Through a replica of reality tryin' to make it life-like
But yet and still I let my son be a kid
Just give him up the real, exactly like my momma did
So when he gets to be a man he'll appreciate
The game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate
And now my son is four years old
I really gots ta give the real and try to play the father's role
Because these years he'll remember most
So it's all about little Marcus and me becomin' close
But I got a bunch of obstacles
If it ain't my line of work it's the girlies on my popsicle
Now everybody's got my baby
Wantin' to have their hands in my pocket tryin to drive me crazy
""It's your daughter, don't she look like you?""
I just can't tell, why don't you take it to ma momma do
Because my mother knows the real deal
All these hoochies poppin' coochie tryin' to get a free meal
So now we in and outta cope
Tryin' to get mo money, braggin' om the child support
Tellin' her friends that she's breakin' me
Now everybody knows, that she was just fakin' G
Come to find out, the girl never had me
She's the baby's mother but me I ain't the baby's daddy
And biological tests can prove
You gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude
But now I finally got a real daughter
No need for the testin'
I know that I'm the baby's father
I heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then
But now I feel ya

I feel ya

Now I'm twenty-two and finally got a grip on life
It's nineteen ninety-three, I put away my pocket knife
And got a bigger stick to fight with
I'm young and black so my choice ain't a nightstick
Because we livin' in a concentration set
And everyday, we face to face with death
I seen my homies go and come
And judgment day is just something we can't run from
So I know my number's comin' up
So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin' up
And even though I hate killin' off my own kind
I gotta be a man and as a man I'm a defend mine
My brother corners trying to keep the neighborhood at peace
Don't fight each other, we got's ta stand and fight the beast
So united we stand but we gonna fall quick
Because we always trying to take another brother's shit
And the cops is in the same vote
Just because we comin' up quick they think we slang dope
They shootin' ta kill, they gas ain't sparkin' goods
They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
And now the story's all twisted up
And if they gave the cop the chair
I really wouldn't give a fuck
Because she left my partner's family with memories
And after hearin' this I know you don't remember me
But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch
I see his parents and then I started breakin' up
Because I know what you did was wrong
But you won't realize until you dead and gone
It ain't no justifiable homicide, you never gave a warning
You straight up shot him from behind
But all the cryin' in the world ain't gonna bring him back
You give a gat to a black he don't know how to act
But you gotta tell your story to the judge
Not the imitation judge, the judge that everybody loves
And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
Then in reality you took care of your business
But regardless I know you want to kill me
But I ain't going' out like that
Ya feel me?

And the government's been taxin' that ( ), gettin' paid
If it's taxable it's cool to smoke, kill or not
And the alcohol is killin' folks? True or not

But now I'm back up in this bitch to hit these niggas with this gangsta shit
I keep the strong rhymes runnin
My shit don't switch, I'm 10 years in, and ain't changed one bit
It's all about the real, nigga
I keeps it real, nigga
And won't sell out for ? ? ? with tommy hilfiger
Fucker, I figure niggas wanna see
The side of society they don't see on tv
So when I bring the shit, I bring the shit like I seen it
And when I scream the shit, I sing the shit like I mean it
No secret, these muthafuckas figure I'm a threat
Cause I ain't fallin short to the traps the demon set
Now sweat, cause now I got my head in your books
And when I think 'cracker', my definition read 'crook'
Now look, we're livin under laws that they set
Back then we were treated like dogs and wasn't shit
And slowly but surely the shit changed
>from they fault, but if you black, then you get blamed
A damn shame, that means this muthafucka's one-sided
And blacks, we get lost in the sauce, because we unguided
These muthafuckas had a plan from the start
Get what they can get and rip they assholes apart
They smart

They smart, man
(those guys...)
You niggas better watch yo ass
(..they're the bad guys)
Them bastards they smart, man
(those guys...)
It's up to us for how long we gon' last
(..they're the bad guys) (2x)

I declare an all-out attack
Let's take our minds behind enemy lines, so we can see how the demon acts
And how he set us up for failure in the first place
And why the fuck did we just settle for a birthday
You see, I'm hip to the games that you run
Like the games you run unfair, we can get no fair one
Cause we was dealt the bad hand from the jump
And we can't deal, so we jack and get drunk
And might end up locked down or six feet
But in these streets a muthafucka gots to eat
You can't sleep, cause if you're caught sleep, you gots to pay
And just like everyone left you got your day
And these days were meant for all to keep tryin
But we can't relate, so we fall and keep dyin
Open your muthafuckin eyes who your enemy
The muthafuckas dyin or the muthafuckas killin you?

You put your crack on my table
I turn my axe on my neighbor
And my back to my savior
You had me thinkin you were almighty
But to the almighty you're just a man that's really all tiny
The maker will open up our minds to see
That heaven ain't a place here on earth, you gots to leave
And once we leave, we stand between eternal peace and eternal pain
And you the beast shall meet eternal flame
So let it rain, wash away up all my bad things
And put some laughter in our hearts again
Now black men, stand up, let's come together as a whole race
And don't be fed up by the old days
They try to do us like the indians, killin us like wild beast
And show more love for the chinese
And kept us trapped up in a small room
And made decisions on our life we accepted that left us all doomed
They sabotaged and they camouflaged
But if these niggas came to crank up some shit, then I be down to ride

I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin

had to find my place

But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue

had to dodge a case

Had to dodge a bullet

And the nigga that tried to pull it

The streets is throwed

If I don't get lean and blowed everyday

I feel just like I'ma explode on overload and overdrive

All my life this drive I tried

I seen a lot of good niggas die

Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched

Or somebody's a bitch

I wish I could change the past

But I gots to live in the present and pray

that tomorrow this shit don't last, I'm livin to fast

Shit, my momma asked me who I was like she ain't know me

But, to tell the truth I didn't know myself

I found out she had to told me

Just to show me just how good I had it

I guess I couldn't see it

Mild-mannered I just couldn't be it

But that was just the way we used to G it

One of the wrongest niggas I see

Or one of the strongest niggas I know

Walkin on my tippy-toe cause the life I live ain't long and I know

So I put weed in the bong and I blow

Stay cool calm and collected a neglected

Child that grew into a man that's widely respected

Too real

I feel no pain

I can't complain

Stuck in the game

Tryin to maintain

Cause I'm so real

We blow big everyday

But that don't stop our pain

Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game

Got niggas doin 40

When you 25 that's life

I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price

These bitch ass niggas shife

Niggas might snitch out they momma

That's why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama

Cause we ain't promised tomorrow

But nigga you promised to die

Nigga can't you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry

At night I talk to God and try to understand

How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man

I guess they already gone, ain't nothin gone bring them back

So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks

I still love my piece of change, wood grain and big head ones

But I had to realize in life everything ain't always fun

I guess that's true for some

But them hoes will never win

Out here just hustlin and grindin

Tryin to change from niggas to men

My nigga you a ho to me

Boy you done went off on me

Runnin round with the fakin and hatin

I'ma blast if you run up on me

I'ma do my dirt by my lonely so that nobody can snitch

This matter coulda been resolved

if you woulda came clean and paid my shit

See niggas disrespect the game but boy you'll never last

Pullin that ho shit sellin your partner out for a piece of ass

And fool you claim you real but really need to be shot up

No respect for your family that's dead

don't write yo peoples locked up

Damn I miss my dog he was hog to this game

Unlike bustas these days that talk down on your name

You boys is funny

I'm bout my money

And oh so true

For shippin' and handelin', taxes was added.

Takin' drugs only 'cause we love money.

Listen for clues.

It takes twenty-eight grams,
Multiplied by thirty-six zips to make
A triple beam brake, a triple beam shake.
A hundred grams on the triple beam flake.
Two point two pounds, to be straight.

Ready to buy 4 kilos,
Then drive slow back to Youngstown, Ohio.

But part not I was blind to the point,
Not even I could see, or that I could be,
Obviously.

Hit me with the type of mystery.
Lay it down like history.
With the intent of me, myself, and I.
Street desire, easily.
Piece of mind, I was least to find.
Some sassiness.
Hossisiless, it gets to shit and praise to the farmer innercist.

I see these niggas and days, go and come
And for me, just to wake, I know I'm blessed
I grab my 'ses and split my Swisher wit' my thumb
Some of my Sweets be tight, now some of my Sweets be fucked up
But all of my Sweets gon' blow, so killa' smoke get sucked up
I lucked today and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say, tomorrow they won't be blasting this-a-way
I'm puffin' spliff's of hay, still upset about the drama here
At this time of year, I'm wiping away my dead homies mama tears (Shit)
But naturally, them fucking laws was always after me
So I have to be, in that manor on that five-oh-three
I'm living dastardly, must be all about survival 'g
These niggas passing me, streets just keep on getting live wit' me
They said there has to be another way, but I ain't feeling that
They tried to steal a Lac, and my wig, they wanna peel it back

Flipping through the Ave, tryna see some good
But everythang is still the same, in my neighborhood
Niggas frown when you up, and smile when you down
And when you change for the better, shife fools stop coming around
I see the jealousy and hating and the wicked ways
We all lost children, praisin' paper, smoking our life away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me, but all we do now is fuck and fight
My conscience fuck wit' me so much that I can't eat or sleep
The other side of selling dope and out there running the streets
And even though I'm gaining street fame, coming from this rap game
Lustful thinking and compulsive drinking is a normal thang
Some get erased and misplaced, trying to win the race
Some try to hold on to they place, by smoking wit' lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gon' change the hood
I'm smoking skunk and popping the trunk to make me feel good

I fli, I flips down the Ave

I'm up early 'cause my nigga
Don't sell dope after night time.
Love choppin' blades, rollin' hooptie
'N move the dope through the pipeline
Pimp C, bitch, holla at yo' bitch,
Now yo' bitch on my team;
Got her buyin' us sticky green
Lace some with promythazine
Candy sweets, a candy bitch,
You lookin' at a candy boy.
I done came down Main and popped trunk,
Hit the switch on my candy toy.
We all young ghetto boys,
That's why we act this way.
Tryin' to see a million dollars,
Hopin' these niggas don't blast today.

Pro smoke, pro choke,
Anti-broke, conservative liberal
Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin'
In criminal court, it's civil.
In the middle of re-al-it-y
Unsolved mys-ter-ies riddle,
Knockin' over fat cats,
And gettin' my thoughts off bits and kibbles.
On note pads I scribble,
Write rippers that'll make you think.
Snap so hard it'll break your synchronicity,
Fuck it, take it, trick,
I fake it...blink 'n poof
We disappearin' into a shroud of dozier
Cloud composures, all-nighters like Folger's
But, bitch, I tried to told ya

Rollin' Seville (rollin' Seville),
Grippin' my steal (grippin' my steal),
My Tahoe real, man, I'm workin' wood wheel.

Marijuana fields (marijuana fields),
Grippin' my steal, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel.

They tellin' me, ""Bun don't go there""
But, man, I just gots to bring it.
These niggas, they wanna hate on that Texas,
But scared to sing it.
They don't know what that star 'bout
They don't know what that bar 'bout
They don't know what that candy car 'bout
Or smokin' that joint 'bout.
All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em
Or what the fuck we sell 'em
Smokin' Swishers, wood grain,
And leavin' stains on cerebellums.
Rebellum, propell 'em, gel 'em
From P.A. to Deep Ellum.
Tell 'em I tol' 'em
Wrote 'em, fuck it, phone 'em
To hell to heaven.

I just spent 60 G's
On a brand new Eldo-reeze,
Black-on-black, drop top 'lac,
Northstar fifth wheel on back.
Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke
When my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch
'Cause I fell in love with my chrome-plated woman.
I love my wood wheel Grant,
'84 Cadillacs that slant,
Slowed-down Screw tapes that knock,
Blowin' on Green private stock.
Bitch, I don't eat hamhocks,
Try 20-ounce Angus beef.
Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggas,
'N got big-ass diamonds off in they teeth.

Grippin' the steal (grippin' the steal),
Nigga, I'm so real (Nigga, I'm so real).
Bitch, how you feel? Nigga, I'm workin' wood wheel.

Smokin' on bionic, ubonic chronic, it's so ironic.
Sippin' gin and tonic, supersonic like Johnny Mneumonic.
We crash your party, piss on your parade,
Sip syrup like it's Lemonade
From Paris to the Palisades to the Promenade
Bomb and fade, closes the car, break worlds, it's plain as day.
That's the game we came to play,
It don't change, ain't a thing to say.

It's goin' down in the H-Town,
Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound,
Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth
I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Ain't got no time to play, girl;
Let me get a little throwed off some good skunk.
Bitch, didn't you know who the fuck I was,
Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so
Bitch tryin' to fuck fast, I'ma fuck slow.
How the fuck you're gonna out-fuck James, ho?
Like Teddy Pendergrass, you better let it go.

Gettin' ready fo, head doctors, show shockers, body rockers,
Late-night do' knockers
Gotta break us off big pimpin', baby, we ho clockers,
Bitch bosses, takin' no losses, best go ask aks Lil' Wee-wee.
Baby brother, Sweet James Jones, guerilla pimpin' at its finest.
Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers behind us, rewind us

Touched like Midas, these bitch-ass niggas they study and bite us.
Couldn't not recite us, come to our show,
And bitch niggas try to fight us.
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave
How the fuck you're gonna go to war

You can be stealing killing or chillin whatever your choice
Smoke some weed smoke ya pipe fuck it
Life if how you live it
I grab the mic while tha DJ groove it (turntable scratch noise)
Explicit lyrics is what um known to kick
Trying to make money so I can make honeys blow on mah dick
I go on a quick mission to find some kil'
Ain't no big deal, just hop in the Seville
Mah homey put me down quarter pound for a bill
Wake up in the morning and I have weed still and I chill
With the brothers sipping coffee
Too old to be listenin' into what you say so hoe get off me
You're born in this world by ya self and you die alone
So as long as ya grown ya might as well gone and just

Do what the fuck you want to do (Go ahead and just)
Say what the fuck you want to say

What did it all mean?
Say what you want hoe ya grown
You make decisions on your own
No one would suffer but you
So do what tha fuck you want to do

Now everybody's got elders and you should respect um
They been through similar shit but then again you can't let um
Put they hands on ya life like a remote control
Have you traveling down the same bumpy tore up road
Now close friends and relatives they should be constantly by ya side
And understand you gotta let ya conscience be your guide
There'll finally come a time for ya self you must decide
Cause you only get a ticket might as well enjoy tha ride and just

And there's a couple of fucked up man made rules that we should follow
But you gotta realize you just might not wake up tomorrow
And the dollar you earn is the doller you spend
Go get something for ya kids or buy a bottle of gin
Is it a sin? I don't (don't) know
What X and O's in this game
Trying to survive, trying to get high, trying to get by and stay alive
So (Do it till ya satisfied) Not just a lil bit
But wait until ya eighty and start saying what you could of did

But what did it all mean?
Say what you want hoe ya grown
You make decisions on your own
No one would suffer but you

Fat sweet in my mouth, a 24 ounce can
Got no time for all that yesterday, he say, she say
Pull out da beat tape
Give it to da DJ
My eyes are tight and shinin'cause I'm smokin' some kill
Don't look at me, go buy some drinks, call up some hoes if you will
I see it nothin' but a party ya'll, I guess I'm the host
Ain't nobody got no mo weed, it time to smoke it
Keep that beat rollin', you see everybodys holdin' their own
You know I gotta bust atleast two or three before I'm gone
But there's always one in da crowd, rappin' loud
I'm in the nigga's mouth after all them bitches and cowards
With the East coast flow, West coast body language
Don't know nothin' bout da South and tryin' to find someone to hang wit
Man when ya finish flowin' or whatever da fuck you doin'
Holla at me, I'll be in da bathroom boo boo'n

Had to get away, needed some time to chill
So I bought a 59 and got behind da wheel
Scooped up a fat sack of kill 'cause I'll be drivin' a while
Takin' two or three pulls every five or six miles
I can't wait to see my roaddogg, you how we do it
Just like a case of beer, piece of cock, we run right through it
And all da bitches know me, I hit quite a few
They be glad to see me, niggaz don't give'em dick like I do
I bust bout two, then they tell they friends, and then I'm in
Wit my French tickler, makin' they pussy lips grin
But there's always one in da crowd, talkin' loud
Found out I fucked her cousin, now she runnin' her mouth
Leavin' notes on my windshield, I'm a bitch, I'm a hoe
Early in da mornin' bitches knockin' at my mama doe
Mama please, when you finish whatever that you doin'
Who ever that is, tell'em I'm in da bathroom boo boo'n

I gotta visit from a old friend, fresh outta county
He said came up on a lick and he was glad that he foind me
He had some niggaz wit him, full of drink and lookin' sweaty
Cockin' gats back talkin' bout ""c'mon Dee man you ready?""
Its a house down da street, about two does down
They sell weed and they least got two whole pound
Man all we gots to do is hit this ride, we cool
Lets fuck his wife and take his weed and bust on that fool
We can all come up, whatever we get, we split
Ain't nobody sayin' nothin', ain't nobody seen shit
So lets pile up five deep in ya lac
He'll know that it is you Dee and won't think its da jack
Man you must be smokin' crack, you don't know who dat is

From the down underground are hangin' around the A-Town
Lookin' for a come up, workin' from 9 to 5
Just to get some change so T-Mo can stay alive
Not greedy or living' lavish yet but you can bet that when I do
Nobody from my crew will I forget
And if I start to get large and come up on some change
I won't change, everybody know they down
It's not the same, everyday life can be different
These laws got me ready to ball
Cause I fall a victim so I still be slanging them fat pillows
To make 'em meet, each and every day as I comb my city streets
Sometimes I wish I never had been apart of this mess
Cause the system got us fucked up
It put us to the test, women and men if you black you in
Food for the soul listen to what I tell you it don't matter
Young or old it's time we loc' up and do like we suppose
We killin' each other over this bullshit and some clothes
We're trapped off in this world and society with no place else to go
So how you feel?

Frustrated, irritated, sometimes I don't know myself I be too numb
To feel something sometimes so I dig deep, get in the Cherokee
Let my mind fly free into the wilderness so I can get this shit off my mind
That's why I be smokin' that dank sometimes, it keeps me from snappin'
Keeps me calm, keeps my mind open, keeps me fond of what I gots to do
Off in the studio to get my old burd back on her feet, and my little bro'
In Statesboro and my little 'cause Mark Twain, all my
Folks that hang with me when I was out in the trap or when I was goin'
Through one of our episodes, only god knows, what I go through so I get down
On my knees, sometimes I come home too high to pray, but I get on my bed
Lay on my back and meditate, anyway, in the ceilings, the four walls
It's like cell therapy I got nothing to do but write about my L-I-F-E, put it
Down on paper, so what you feel?

I live for today, motherfuck another hour, it might be sour
Never know my day, so I'm prayin' in the shower
Look up and thank the Lord for forgiveness, a witness to bad
I'm lookin' for good in the Southwest, God bless my neighborhood
It's people killin' in the street to eat
Surviving the day is the only goat that I set
Just to make it home, I'm not alone
Someone's out to get me when I haven't done shit wrong

My head felt swoll, mista couldn't see past my mouth
What route did you take man
Caught me by that loops of my pants
Got me on the curb lettin' tha traffic pass me by
No questions I said nothing
Lookin' for the mutant to be buckin'
The law naw, man Gipp show him my shit
Close my mouth then I dip
See to me G is a person who understand the plan
Can't make no moves when you in the hands of the man
They got some new suites down Peachtree
Left wing for the Feds, right wing for tha hardheads
Makin' more deals than Buddy Folks made with Hartsfield
Somebody don't want my face in the place, for 96 shit's slick
Got me clean, lookin' fresh, dogs be scratchin' at my chest
Under the order of who? Guess who ain't non-iller than miller
Want to 1, 2 your ass no more life what you gave was the past
'cause ain't no future want to millicamp your case
Disgrace your face, make it seem to be safe
But ain't no place to run

Sometimes I don't even know how I'm gon' eat
'Bout twenty dollars away from being on the street
Shit, you might see a nigga on tv
But hell it's almost like I'm rappin' for free
That little money be gone, got dammit, I'm grown
Gotta help keep the heat and lights on
It would be nice to have mo' but I kinda like being po'
At least I know what my friends here fo'
I want to lie to you sometimes, but I can't
I want to tell you that it's all good, but it ain't
It's nigga's hurtin' and uncertain 'bout if they gon' make it or not
That's why we got nigga's killing
Feelin like they coming up off a little dope they sold
You can get some gold but we won't make it as a whole
Cause without you there'd be no me
And without no unity there will never be any happiness
You could smoke a pound of sess and it still won't relieve yo' stress
God bless my, thought process

The thought process
Now as an Outkast I was born, wasn't warned of the harm
That would come to meet me like Met Life, but yet life
Done sent me through a lot of up's and down like it ain't nothing'
Like elevators but I ain't the one that's pushin' the buttons
I got off at the 13th floor, when they told me that it wasn't one
They said it skipped from 12 to 14
Still smoking, still drinking, no I'm sittin' on the Lincoln
4 A.M. thinkin' that in reality the world is like a ball full of playas
We trapped off in this maze with walls made of layers
And only prayers is the tightest game that you can have
The devil's takin' a swing that might explain the broken glass
But my crystal ball see the pistol fall to the wayside
Nobody would die in cops and robbers when we used to play right

Huh, the only thang we feared was Williams, Wayne
Never though about hittin' licks or slangin' caine
Didn't think I'd be the one to give in to abortion
Label me murder because my ass is scorchin'

Pass me da green, i need some weed with my hennessy (repeat 8 times)
(Inhale....exhale) Eyes selling red, got my dank from the Bahamas
Went to see my girl smoke some green with her mama.
Jumped in my Cutlass on the way to the liquor store.
Picked up some blunts, got ten on the 2-0.
Fix these palm trees wit some green leaves
Got a nigga's head spinning like the seven seas.
Puff, puff, pass, nigga that's what Simon say
Fools that hog the green or da weed gonna get carried away.
Fingernails burnt, lookin like a tweeker
Ears steadily poppin, but not from the speakers
Green got me hungry, feindin' for them munchies
cause real smokers don't blow no fuckin green on empty stomachs
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my hennessy (repeat 4 times).
Green trees pack wood, make cabbage
I like to get high but it ain't a bad habit.
??????? with that weed smoke comin out my lac
Got a ??? in the front and one in the back
Blowin shotguns to me and my homie
I feel like this weed make a young nigga horny
I stopped the fuckin lac at Holiday Inn
I ain't even trippin, told the girls to come in
Laid her down steady cause she know I'm ready
Choppin up weed like muthafuckin spaghetti
Hoes down south must know voodoo
cause every time i hit the weed I'm lookin for Isuzus
Pass me da green, i need some weed with my hennessy (repeat 5 times)
y'all high yet?
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my hennessy(repeat 3 times)
Damn nigga y'all chokin, get the fuck out of here nigga.
Pass me da green i need some weed with my hennessy

Soda pop it, watch it sizzle, man

Step up in da club and have dem whisperin' 'goddamn, she thick.'
Take it to the bar; Hypnotic and Hennessey is on my list
Seductively moving my body; now watch me rock my hips
Take a sip of the goose
I'm lookin' good and livin' lavish
Big boy pimpin', popin', dippin'
Now tell me I'm not tha baddest

I walk in da club and she wobble and shakin'
I wanna take her to the house
So a playa can start breakin'
In her muthafuckin' back, like a playa suppose, goddamn
Lil' body, touch your toes, goddamn
Lil' body, take off yo' clothes
And let me see dat apple bottom and
Dat brown booty hole

Thirteen years old expose themselves
To any Tom, Dick and Hank
Got mo' stretch marks than these hoes hollin they got rank
See Sega aint in this new world order
Dem experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas they trained assassins
To do search and seize aint knocking or askin'
Dem coming for niggas like me Po' white trash, like they
Tricks like her back in slavery

Concentration camps laced with gas pipes lines
Inferno's outdoors like they had back
When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me later on
In the future, look it up where they said it
Aint no more constitution in the event of a race war
Places like operation heartbreak hotel moments tear
Until air tight vents seat off despair
Dem say expect no mercy, fool
You should be my least worries, gotta deal with W-2's,
1099's unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines

Who's that peeking in my window
POW nobody now
Who's that peeking in my window

Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
A gate with the serial code was put up next
They claim that this community is so drug free
But it don't look that way to me
Cause I can see the young bloods hanging out at the sto
Oh you know what else they tryin to do make a curfew
Especially for me and you the traces of the new
World order time is getting shorter

If we don't get prepared, people, this' gone be a slaughter
My mind won't allow me to not be curious
My folk don't understand so they don't take it serious
But every now and then,
I wonder if the gate was put up to keep crime out or to keep our ass in

Who's that peeking in my window
POW nobody now
Who's that peeking in my window
POW nobody now

Listen up, little nigga, I'm talking to you
About what yo little ass need to be going through
I fall a victim too and I know
I shouldn't smoke so much but I do with the crew
Everyday on the average 'bout 4 or 5
I'm lucky to be alive at sunrise now I realize the cost after I lost
My best friend Bean I recognize as a King
Who am I to tell you to stop smokin
Now you're open to disease and colds and ain't 16 years old
This shit has got to stop let's take a walk through detox
I want outta this hold I'm in a cell
Under attack loc up folks they in the hood,
Got an eye on every move I make
Open your face to info you aint know cause it's kept low
How the new world plan reeks the planet without the black man

So what's your angle, try to separate me from the
Blood is disrespect like coming in my home and not
Wiping your feet on tha rug the Citron Absolut
Has got me bucking no hang with no phony
Lookout for the man with tha mask and the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes always on my heels
Insane, plain, soldiers coming in the dark by plane

To enforce the new system by reign
Tag my skin with your computer chip
Run your hand over tha scanner to buy you dish now -
No more fishing for your fish
Kiss tha days of tha old days past ways gone
Mind blown, conception, protection
My name on your selections but I caught you coming POW!

When ya livin on the eastside, ghetto

That I'm steadily blowin your back out
Watch me track out on these niggas and bounce out on these hoes
Get at em like ""what's up trick"" you know how it goes
It's Friday night, the club is about to close
And I was lookin fabulous
So I,  got up to stretch 'bout to catch me one of these stragglers
True eastside dogs, and we barkin not simpin
Yo holmes 'bout that time to start this parking lot pimpin
I keep that thang, huh, posted in the same spot
Nothin but my khaki shorts, house shoes, boxers and my suede shine
I'm from the home of the riots
That's before the peace died but I'm still hollin out eastside

Uhh, what y'all busters gon do
When the pimps, bangers, and hustlers smash on you
It aint about who's sellin the most caine
Put us all together nigga see you run thangs
If you can't hang, stay the fuck out the kitchen
Bitch I'm ghetto fabbed out, so fuck politickin
Waitin for a chance and the shit it never happened
Time is money, and when you get it keep it clackin
All you hear is, with my two inch twist
I keep the goodyear grip, so the dubs don't slip
If you want my claims, I think you besta make a change
So close your eyes when I let my back end hang
I ride til the motherfucking wheels fall off
Domie's got daytons, Goldie's got daytons

All burnt to the turf up in a goddamn fool
Old school motherfucker breakin jaws and rules
Choose to bang, who's to blame but myself and the set
All my peers through the years steady gettin it whet
Give me a rep, that's what I wanted most in my life
Did it all like a hawk, so I'm totin my stripes
Will I quit it, I'm comitted til the day I drop
Slangin rocks, sprayin shots, sayin fuck the cops
Locked up in the Chevy and my switches is hot
Gave em pain as I swang on the bitches I sopt
Bandanna on the antenna swangin and ridin
Eastsidin, ghetto life is invitin

Me and my brother had to walk to school
I used to get him he downposed for joe cool
A couple of dickies, with some quarter sacks
Damn cuz I can't believe my kinfolk gave me that
Had a nigga lookin G'd up
With the scarf on my head, stealin sheets on my bed
I seen baloney sandwiches without no motherfuckin bread
I stole a pack of chips with the big homie Fred
Now we sippin on some kool aid
I got suspended from school for cussin out the teacher's aid
And now I'm bout to get a whoopin, but you know I'm steady woofin
On the side where they ride the most

And we ghetto like a motherfuckin hot buttered toast
In the mornin with some government cheese (government cheese)

Recognize royalty when you hear it
The throne has been taken, so kiss this nigga's earring
Luda, throw some grapes on these bitches!

These bitches throwing rose petals at my feet mayne!
They wanna spoil me, treating me like royalty
What am I 'sposed to do? It's such a sweet thang
Work that track, whip 'em like Kunta
That's why they stay down, they loyal citizens of Zamunda
By way of A-T-L; if you disagree
Don't even look at me ho, don't pass go, just go straight to jail
With no probation or bail, but this ain't Monopoly
It's Jolly Green Giants, 'cause we smoke so much broccoli

Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's! Luda's oodles of noodles
And testin' me is like pitbulls put up to poodles
My rap career goes back further than yo' father hairline
It's Ludacris, I pack more nuts than Delta Airlines

And even got my coats bumped up to first class
I'm boss to all employees and I'm here to teach the principle
'Cause I've been saved by mo' bells than Lark Vorhees

And coming up shorter than five Danny DeVitos
I'm on a cool ranch, get laid more than Fritos
With five strippers, four wives and three amigos

I go scuba divin' in Bays at Montego
I find gold links and snatch 'em like I'm Deebo
But I'm the light-skinteted version of Mandingo
I've seen more Beatles and Jagged Edges than Ringo
I used to run numbers in line, they called me bingo
'Cause I'm big, you a little star, you just twinkle
Old asses like sharpeis, y'all all wrinkled
And I stay with more bullets than yo' Billboard singles

Leavin' the keys off in the ignition, makin' me guilty by suspicion
Penny pinchers trying to stack for '96
Buyin' another Fleetwood, Diamond took it, so know we's in the mix
I need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off
'Cause them niggas at the corner sto' been lookin' at me for too long
Starin' like accidents on highways
High days are better than sober ones
Don't be biased, but I know it has to come (uh)

Ridin' past funeral fields holdin' bodies of my peers
If you don't educate yo'self
Now how the fuck you gonna understand how you 'posed to get paid?
Niggas walk around get with shade tree ass ways
Fuck a fade, let my hair drag

Back and forth like a see-saw
Jumping Lily, to lilypad dag
Lookin' to get my Goodie feel

Tired of being blast at, but didn't cast that
I done asked for my life, and right there was laughed at
But when I backtracked, (?)
Blast back

Told 'em to cast that, take these rounds and add that
But fact is you don't fuckin' choose yo' wars
Or be like me muthafucka and do it with two guns

Check my war wounds (uggggh)

Every soldier got a story to tell

My adversary's get popped
Got me runnin' from cops

Got me carryin' two glocks

My enemies is bad
Chop limes of grass
Drive-bys and rags
And representin' red and blue flags

See I got fools from the ghetto
Like my cousin' Jimmy wear permanent metals
My evidence is satus with hoes
Bloody Polos

Pullin' in car do's
And cut up Jabos

I'm down the blast for my homies
And cash for my homies
Even if I'm old G I'll be down to ride and die
If the hood call me

That's why I be hustin' every day
Could you imagine me with no stash?
Like a bank with no cash
Tryin' drive a car with no gas

And fuck one day with no tag?
Shotgun with no class
Window with no glass
Or all you girls with no ass

Caliope crawler
A Down South Hustla
Plus a head buster from New Orleans

See I gotta be a paid nigga
A made nigga
Be the nigga to bust yo' shit
And the nigga the be the grave digga

See my tattoos reveal some of the shit I done did
But the move of other niggas that bout it
Feel the shit I do just tah live
See I been scared, popped at, and shot at

But I live an eye for eye
So the enemies I ain't forgot that

It's real, shit's real check my war wounds
This here real life, ain't no fuckin' cartoons
I'm the Saudi Arabian death killin' veteran on the tube
Either me or you right here

Come back and hang out in my room
I done shot my rifle, trained to kill
Got blood on my fatiques
Once you in ain't no turnin' back

Lay yo' ass over seas
Might as well handle your business
There's no overcome to this shit
Be on yo' Ps and Qs nigga

Don't cry like no bitch
You see a weak nigga, that's a beat nigga
And fuck a stead nigga, that's a dead nigga
Tell my mama not to worry bout me why I'm gone

If I die bitch, box me up and ship me back home
Bury me in the N.O. with my stripes on my chest
Tell them muthafuckas that I did my best
Middle finga pointin' sayin' fuck Iraq
If you don't believe me check my combat pack

A motherfuckin' story to tell (What?)
Fool, I got a muthafuckin' story the tell

And every nigga in the jail cell knows it well

Stayin' way cut throat
I hang out, slang out, at hotel rooms
Up all night gettin' in gun fights
I strike my head on the wall

Presidential roll, gold rolex watch
With no rocks
I save them for the pinky

He ain't wearin' platinum, Naw
But I keep you niggaz thinking
Mink seats sure to keep a nigga sinkin'
Swear he ain't slangin'
But I know that nigga creepin'
Got a condo, in Orlando
For the weekend

Homes be so crunk in the club
We gotta sneak in
No more room in the V.I.P
They payin' just to peek in
When they leave
They be lookin in a car
They can't even see in
And that's just the
Be-gin-ning
In the city that he in
He was rappin' in the cafeteria
But now that nigga serious
Heard he got a CL, a EXT on Spreewells
Several Chevy's on 24's
(Hold up), ""how many records he sell?""
Man I don't know
But he got a label now
Them boys, the PSC (hell)
I heard Atlantic gave 'em a deal for
2 or 3 mill. (ay, shawty)

Like the dope man phone number
Roll anything I can throw some 24's under

Nigga talk bad 'bout the man
But I shole wonder
Why the dope boys fuck with 'em
And the hoes love 'em
Very little promotions on this album
Never heard of 'em
But it's jammin' like the fuck
Was jumpin' out the stores
'Cause I was born in the raid
And I'm made in the streets
I done played in the days
In the shade in the streets
I say I rapped in the trap
With the best in the streets
Shot craps in the back
You know the rest, nigga please
You doin' business with me
You best invest in some skills
I sell slopes of snow
I don't fuck with little blow nigga
Got 80 k's, it's gone take a little more (to what?)
To double up and bring it back
And make a little more (You movin' slow)
And movin slow, now what you take a nigga for?
I'ma cock hammers and 44's
And nail yo ass to the floor
And I ain't braggin', I'm just letting niggaz know
'Cause the media and radio can get a nigga so
Fucked up
Comparin' me to these niggaz little flow
I do a song
Fuck up they whole little show (so shawty)

See the bullet in the chamber
Cocked it back and out of anger

And now I'm feelin like I'm loosin my grips on all reality

But my reality is a battle G
And I was tired of havin talks with myself about mentality
End it all I stand tall apparently I wasn't patient enough

She said probably happen when I get much older
But I kinda wish it would of happened then

Mom told me never trust these niggas
And ummm never put your faith in the bitch
See I hang with a bunch of grave yard villians
Nigga robbin' sprees we stealin'

Click like pistol with killers
They tried to preech to me, couldn't preech to me
Tried to teach me, couldn't teach me
See I've gotta learn the hard way on my own
'cause nobody else could give me a reason
They always told me I'll probably end up dead
Or in the pen see me and P some outcasts
Can't arrest the family tellin' the kids not to be like him
And see it was ruff some times but it had to be
Enough trippin' on Cess go hand your back and pass the weed
I ran wild deep in the game off of change

Hypnotized by change after fortune and fame

Fairy tales are for children we ain't story book livin'
South streets be bloody from all the shootin' and killin'
Villians ride for similac and crack and smack
And its a fact all killers ain't inner city blacks

With rocks and stacks and be packed to get their scraps

And I ain't even goin' lie, I'm a thug
But I got a question for you
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me
What's up?

So what you want to do
A girl like me, a guy like you
What we could do
It's whatever baby anything that we want to
Will I fall for a thug like you

Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me and um
In fact if you could
I got money now
Can you see yourself if you had to move back up in the hood

Now during sex lay there I'm a have to ask if it's good
This rap stuff stressful let's go see if we can relax in the woods
When I first met you at the bus stop lookin' all shy-like
Tellin' your friend how much that you hated my type

But I'm ready to change,
I'm willin' to put the game on it, put the range on it
Put powerful things on it
Sooner or later probably have tattos with my name on it

Now look I like to live fast, addicted to cash, the 45 on the dash
And you know me, if you know me, o.g. I'm down to act bad
I need a more than a friend but not quite a relationship
A girl when I come off tour I can't wait to get with

Not the stupid chick the one I probably could vacation with
You gotta go somewhere you know what boo go ahead
Take the six
Now you gotta make a choice either wrong or right
You tried before maybe you just need a thug in your life
What's up

So what you want to do
A girl like me, a guy like you
What we could do
It's whatever baby anything that we want to
Will I fall for a thug like you

You keep, keep on askin me
If I, say if I want to be with you
The tough part is to think I could
Fall for some body like you

You advanced, took a couple chances and shit
Chances with bricks, couple chances now you sittin in
Mansions and shit
You done gambled with this thug and won

You know what I'm sayin it's thug life
Cock the glock, pop the glock, drop the top and run
I can't change I'm to deep in it so let me know if you wit me
Can't make no promises but if we make it through boo

Then sky's the limit
We on the west on the beach, we takin trips to the east
Takin shoppin sprees 'til they damn near hurt our feet
Got you a five when you like smashed the four

Didn't even wreck it you just laid there and scratched the door
Step out the house it's more like a fashion show
Anything and everything you want you got that you ain't even gotta
Ask no more...imagine that

It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damn ghetto for me
All my girls think I'm not quite ready for you
So now I try to sneak away to be with you

So what you want to do
A girl like me, a guy like you
What we could do
It's whatever baby anything that we want to
Will I fall for a thug like you

Every woman need a down man

739,West Savannah,OutKast,"Yeah, haha
I'm back off in this bitch
One more time, to drop this rhyme
'Bout where my roots at
Yeah, Westside is in the house
Frazier Homes is in the house
Cloverdale is in the house
And Savannah, GA is in the house, so check it

February 1st, 1975 it happened
Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin'
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin' that sack, now he's gots responsibilities
Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
And she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin'
Around Frazier Home, down in the West Side projects
Changin' over foodstamps, and hittin' a lick was next see
I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin', or floatin', a Brougham is what I'm sportin'
Sade is in my tape deck, I'm movin' in slow motion boi
So meet me deep in the streets that's where I learned the capers
Us lickin' blunts, lickin' leaves, rollin' reefer papers
I'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggas around the ave. and the hoes, they love me
They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin' cable off in every room
So follow the fiends, follow my lead through the nooks and crannies
It's everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me
But go 'head on, with that foolishness bitch
Let me get lovely with my swerve because I'm true to this shit
And if you comin with eight dollars, you shit out of luck
Because the West Side ain't takin no shorts on the dime
So fire it up

Now, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmm, hmm
(Like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)
Nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmm, hmm
(And it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)

See, niggas in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains
Been doin it for years, so these niggas ain't gone change
They comin' around the ghetto so you might call 'em soul
Been wearin' furry Kangol's, so that shit is old
You might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent
Five dollars for a table dance so now your money's spent
You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk
As long as there's that ""tic tic"" followed by that bump
I'm down to stick a ho if she got a G-string
'Cause the niggas in the Point ain't changed, mane
You might call us country, but we's only Southern
And I don't give a fuck, P-Funk spot to spark another

Now, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmm, hmm

And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'em
And teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse
And now she tripping talking 'bout I need to be in church
And my lil' girl whole family tryna' lie in court
Trying to put me, a child, on child support
And my own family deny me of what I do 'cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'
Plus, my niggas keep falling to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas melting away
Man they got clowns right around me, killing they self everyday
We keep fighting but they so strong
I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on
Just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust
And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck

I mean the world just ain't gon' never change

So I just keep my head up and my nuts, let 'em hang
Dog I swear it's very rough out here for the youngsters
Like everybody against me 'cause I'm a young thug
Dear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?
But I'ma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil' Rabbit
That's why this lil' nigga be bugging like it's no tomorrow
I only can depend on macita and C-M-R
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away
And police got me under surveillance when and wherever
Wrecking they brains, trying to figure where I'm getting that cheddar
I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone
I can handle all a my business, this lil' man grown
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everything was cool I wouldn't write this damn song

Remember the excuses and the lies I had to tell
?Put penance? for your bail, even though you gave me hell
When you was snortin more than half of what you had to sell
Put up with all your flings, hold my head, feelin sad
But through all the bull, you know it wasn't that bad
You used to make me laugh, show me love and respect
But if you don't make a change, you'll be callin me your ex
Can't keep runnin in and out

My psychic told me she have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad ass to ShowBiz?

I pulled up in the Benz, they all got a pen
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be paid

Love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

I used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town

I ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue, I was dazing in a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

I was there when they crucified my Lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide

Are you gonna go my way?

I don't know why we always cry
This we must leave and get undone
We must engage and rearrange
And turn this planet back to one

So tell me why we got to die
And kill each other one by one
We've got to hug and rub-a-dub
We've got to dance and be in love

That stuff that you heard
That they say about me

But some of it's fiction some of it's fact
AND you HATE hearing that about your love
You let it go in one ear and out the other
That he say, she say, they say, I heard
They be fake, we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be

Told her to bust it open let me see what's really happenin'

Booty bigger than the pussy
And cuchi dat make me happy
And I'm all the way in your city
I'm from Louisiana so you gotta show me how your
City do it for the camera
Make it drop and bring it back to the top

Girl you can give it to me it ain't nothing I can't handle

And I'm finna flip her backwards

I got enough bread to take me and you to London
And back to America and all over the country

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
(That girl, that girl, that girl...)

I saw you lookin' at me baby, I've been looking at you too
Tryna understand the thing that you want MJ to do
Ain't it funny how the time easily slips away?
I've been thinking about you sugar, every moment, every day

And we lay upon the beach, we can each get cozy
On the other end where the beeper don't know me
Show me, any little thing that you feel like
Let me know the spot that gets you hot and make it feel right

Ain't no use in playing silly elementary games
We can be connected with a number and a name
Strange how women make you chase them for a while
Then when you approach them they get timid like a child

Ain't no sugar in my tank, no deductions in my bank
Never never, mathematic skills too clever
Forever trying to get her on a trip to my world
Seven days, six nights
That girl, that girl

That girl knows that she's so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand?
That I could surely be her man (that girl, that girl)

Came a nigga baby can we get out, go oversea
Leave your mind at the house, bring you body with me
I've been really taking notes on the way that you maintain
You're one out of a kind, entitled to the same thing

Opportunity knocks for you, girl let it be
It ain't no stop to the (thrill, I'ma scene)
I know that you're wondering how long could it last
But trust in the future and let today be the past

I'm begging, you guessing, he just got good lines
But all I be visionin' is some real good times
That we could be having within the blinkin' of an eye
Impossible dream, we can achieve if we try

It's the brother who cut for you mentally and physically
What would it take for you, do you really want to get the G?
My mission to hold my angel, my pearl
But we still live as strangers
That girl, that girl, that girl

That girl knows that she's so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand?
That I could surely be her man (that girl, that girl)

You look marvellous in them jeans, black queen
Thinking about the entrance you made at the club scene
You know you're looking good so I just let it ride
Too many in the hood that have already tried

Now you said you be looking for things I can't produce
Like a fast life and quick dreams
I tell the truth, competition is blowing my hustle about position
Concidences keep us apart

It's hard to listen to somebody that you don't even trust
You don't know
Places that I want you to come, you don't go
Handball, playing the game of cat and mouse

807,After the Pain,Betty Wright,"Well, I couldn't resist the urge
To tell you the end of my story
For all those who wanted to know
Was there life after the pain?

After the pain, you come and love me
And I welcome you, you're a glad sight to see
And after the rain and all that I have been through
I still can't explain how I can still love you like I do?
But I do, yes, I do

Still love you like I do
(After the pain)
Though you still do me like you do
(After the pain)

After the pain, we sit and we talk awhile
And I fight with all my might
To hold back the tears from falling with a pleasant smile

And after the rain, I can't believe you
Got the nerve to still call me, baby
And I try to tell you, “No, it ain't so”
But I guess “No” just ain't in me

‘Cause boy, I still love you like I do
(After the pain)
Though you still do me like you do
(After the pain)

Yeah, I know you're laughin'
Those of you who heard 'Pain'
Yeah, you're right, I sure did
I said I'd never take him back again

Well, it's a woman's prerogative to change her mind isn't it?
But we do it all the time
Don't laugh, you probably done the same thing too
It's just that you know me and I don't know you

You know one thing, time has taught me that
Havin' a piece of man is better than havin' no man at all
So I'ma just take what I got and work with it
You understand what I mean

And don't you remember thinkin' back just a few years
When people used to try to help you stay together
They find out you're on the verge of breakin' up
They used to cook up a little food and throw a little party
And whisper things in your ear like

Don't blame Mr. Charlie, Mr. Charlie is just a man
And he's doing the best he can
I heard 'em say, “Don't blame Mr. Charlie, Mr. Charlie is just a man
And he's doing the best he can”

That's why I still love you like I do
(After the pain)
Though you still do me like you do
(After the pain, the pain)

I know that you know it's true
After all I've been through
I should be through with love
But there's a God up above

That keeps sayin', “Betty try
Don't give up, you know why
The sun is gonna shine
'Cause you are mine, all mine”

You just keep doin' your best
And I will do the rest
'Cause I love you, love you, Betty, like I do

That's why I still love you like I do
(After the pain, the pain)
Though you still do me like you do
(After the pain, the pain)

My love is deeper than any ocean
And my love is higher than any mountain
It's, oh, it's full of emotion
My love is full of devotion

My love is in and out of season
And I love you with or without a reason
You see God is gonna bless me for lovin' you
For all the times that you treated me wrong and I kept bein' true

You see, God's eyes they're not closed
He's not asleep
Said He's watchin' everything move you make
Every secret you keep

Boy, you better be careful
Hoo hoo hoo hoo
Said if you treat me bad or make my sad
My Father in heaven is watching you

But I still love you like I do
(After the pain)
And nobody's ever gonna love you like I do
(After the pain)

No one's ever gonna love you like I do
No one's ever gonna love you like I do
No one's ever gonna love you like I do
I don't know why I do, but I do, yes, I do
(After the pain)

Oh, there's a woman in me that keeps on lovin' you
(After the pain, the pain)
I don't know why, oh, I don't know why
(I don't know why, baby)
(After the pain, the pain)

I don't know why
(I don't know why, baby)
But I do
(I do)

Said I do
(I do, I do, I do)
Said I
(After the pain, the pain)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)

Do, I don't know why, baby
(After the pain, the pain)
But I love you so, yes, I do

It's rather extraordinary, so you bust this commentary
A literary, genius, and a superior beat creator
Have come together and we made a
Musical composition which we think is a remedy
To cure all the dance floors that's empty
You wanna dance? We got what you want
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin' out with the brand new funk

It was kinda an accident, the way that it happened
One day I was rappin', and on the beat, Jeff was backin' me up
And all of a sudden, he brought in a cut
And I dropped my microphone and said
""What the? Hol' up, Jeff, wait a minute, play it""
He just smiled and said ""Yeah def ain't it?""
It was (funky)
It made me wanna (get, get down)
And we knew almost at once it was the (brand new funk)

So we continued to listen to it
And we knew it was def when I started rappin' to it
So I gave a hi-five to Jeff
And without hesitation popped in my cassette
I took it home that night and analyzed it
Rewound the tape over and over and memorized it
That Friday we went to the club
And out and out cold tore it up

You shoulda seen the people dancin' and shakin' and movin' and jumpin' and spinnin' and clappin'
While the beatboxin' was groovin' and screamin' and yellin' while on the microphone I was flowin'
Fresh rhymes I was showin', the people say ""Yo, keep goin'""
So I continued to rock
While Jeff was on the beatbox
Special assistance from my homeboy, ready rock
People barged just to get up front to get a bird's eye view of what we call the brand new funk

Yo Jeff! (Rock the beat)
Yo Jeff! (Rock the beat)
Yo Jeff! (Rock the beat)
(Beat)
Yo Jeff! (Rock the beat)
Yo Jeff! (Rock the beat)
Yo Jeff! (Rock the beat with yo' hands)

Now get funky with the beat

Now turn it all around

The most original, amazing, astounding, miraculous, remarkable, startling, sensational, stupendous
Music that has ever been created is ours, but believe me it was complicated
But we have dunnit, so now we can breathe

I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did

I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nothing funny
Stop smilin', be still, don't nothing move, but the money
But now I learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search for a nine-to-five, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistlin' this
Feeling out of place, 'cause man do I miss

A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money, it's still a wish
'Cause I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
So now's a test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, 'cause I'm paid in full

Rakim, check this out
Yo, you go to your girl's house and I'll go to mine
'Cause my girl is definitely mad 'cause it took us too long to do this album
Yo, I hear what you're sayin', so let's just pump the music up and count our money
Yo, well check this out
Yo, Elai
Turn the bass down and just let the beat keep on rockin'... and we outta here

813,Jus Lyke Compton,DJ Quik,"Finally out the motherfuckin see-p-t
Off to other cities and shit
No longer just an underground hit
Movin thangs... a local nigga made good
And made a name off of making tapes for niggaz in the hood
And now, let me tell a little story
About the places that i been to and the shit that i been through
Like fightin and shootouts and bangin and shit
All because a nigga made a hit, check it
Nineteen-ninety-one, it was double or nothin that a nigga would hit
Then we broke out with the fonky shit
About bitches and niggaz and gettin drunken off that bud
I was doing the shit they hadn't heard of
But foolish was i to think that it wasn't no other cities like this
And that they didn't like this
That compton was the home of a foot in yo ass
Where you got blast
And now that's just a thing of the past
Let me tell ya why firsthand, we did a show up in oak-land
And niggaz was kickin up sand, to them bangin ain't nothin new
And slangin ain't nothin new
And for every nigga we done shot
They done shot two
Straight through and on since the sixties before i was born
Families of young niggaz mourn
So i'm just letting you know
That if ya plan to take a trip to the bay
Keep your hand on the clip
Becaue oakland... <is jus lyke compton>
Yeah, i'm telling why'all oakland... <is jus lyke compton>
Moving on to st. louis, where thecountry is fucked
With gold teeth int hey mouth, but they still know what's up
Where it's hot as a motherfucker
Hot enough to make ya cuss
That's why i kept my ass on the bus
But later on, whenit cooled off we came down
And met a couple of friends
Who put us up on the st. louis cap
The smith center, with big bob, little steve, tojo, biss and rich
And a couple of bitches
Then they took us to a man named gus in a store
He put me down with a herringbone and shoes galore
That's when i started thinking that this wasn't like home
But then they had to prove me wrong
'cause later that night after we did the show
We went back to the afterset, and wouldn't ya know
Yeah, bloods and crips start scrappin and shootin -- in missouri?
Damn, how could this happen?
Now st. louis... <is jus lyke compton>
Yeah why'all, st. louis... <is jus lyke compton nigga>
I don't think they know, they too crazy for their own good
They need to stop watchin that ""colors"" and ""boyz in the hood""
Too busy claimin sixties, tryin to be raw
And never ever seen the shaw
But now, back to the story that i'm tellin
We packed up the tour bus one more time and started bailin
When we arrived i saw red and blue sweatsuits
When i'm thinkin bout horse dookey and cowboy boots
I guess texas ain't no different from the rest
And san antonio, was just waitin to put us to the test
And before it was over the shit got deep
A nigga got shot in the face, and was dead in the street
Then they came in the club thinkin of scrappin
Little did they know that we was packin
Yeah, we was puttin em down and squaring the rest, shit
I even had to wear the bulletproof vest
Now san antonio... <is jus lyke compton>
Yeah, san antonio... <is jus lyke compton bitch>
After a month on the road
We came home and i can safely say
That l.a. is a much better place to stay
How could a bunch of niggaz in a town like this
Have such a big influence on niggaz so far away?
But still my story ain't over 'cause i got one more to tell
And the people of colorado, they know it well
It was all in the news and if you don't remember
I had this show i did in denver
With a punk ass promoter in a bunk ass skating rink
Bitches was loving it, but niggaz was shovin and shit
To the front of the stage to throw their gang signs
But i'm getting paid so i didn't pay it no mind
Then i poured out my brew onto their face and chest
Then they start throwin soda, and fuckin up my guests
When it was over two niggaz needed stitches
Got cracked in they jaw for being punk ass bitches
Now denver... <is jus lyke compton>
Yeah why'all, denver... <they want to be like compton, bitch>
And ya know that oakland... <is jus lyke compton>
Yeah why'all st. louis... <we made it jus lyke compton, fools>
Uh-huh, san antonio... <is jus lyke compton>
Yeah, and denver... <they want to be lyke compton, punk ass niggaz!>

Load my slugs up
Hey yo back up cube dogg we passed that bitch muggs up
Pull over and let me out this show no sight

Everybody in the ghetto, know what you're doing

Claiming that you're loco
But you ain't mexican
Listen to ""no vaseline"" before you flex again
Fucking with tha hoggs
You say you bloods
But you ain't nothing but a dogg fool
On tour only rapping to tha yuppies
We the big fish that'll make a dish out you fucking guppies
So who y'all with?
Niggas down with cypress can wipe this shit off my dick
Has I stick it like king kong
And play ping pong
With this fake ass cheech and chong
Did you tell ya
Momma that I had to help ya
When sen dogg left your bitch ass in australia
You say that I took your hook?
It must be the white boy thinking all niggas crooks
Now what? you hip-hop hippies
How you fucking junkies
Think you gonna punk me?
And chill
And deal with tha fact that you ain't got enough skill

You need to stay down you Compton clown

And get off of the nuts of the niggaz with guts
Because I'm down with the Trees, I'm down with Death Row
I'm down with Black Tone, and I'm down with the fo'
So when we cross paths and I hope that's soon
I'ma boot your motherfuckin' ass to the moon
You need to quit bangin' under false pretense
'Cause if don't make dollars, it don't make sense

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the people, commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

Now I'ma swing it to the right and, right into the left hand
Take a deep breath and, cook it like a chef and
This is dedicated to the see-P-T
No better yet T-T-P, or the niggaz that look up to me
I make it my business, to be that true forever
And whenever I can come clever well that's my endeavor
So whether or not you understand, that there's only one DJ Q-you-I-K
With no see still you can't be me
Because I'm floatin' in my Lex and, depositin' fat checks and
Gettin mad sex while I floss the NSX and

Doin' what I wanna, and youse a goner nigga
For thinkin that you can catch me slippin' on a street corner
Remember Compton's in the house, and Quik is in the hood
Sippin' yak with all my niggaz 'cause it's tooted good
So don't knock it till you try it, 'cause Eiht he tried to knock it
But he's still walkin' round with my nuts in his pocket
So put tha P in it represent and sip that Miller
And for those of y'all concerned, this is still Eiht Killa
Let me take a load off my scrotum little pest
If it don't make dollars nigga, you know the rest

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the people, commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

Now I done sold my fuckin' soul to the shit that I kick
While you groupie ass niggaz keep on ridin' the dick
You oughta know that DJ Quik ain't your average
Everyday motherfucker, slick like a snake 'cause I stuck ya
Now, I never had my dick sucked by a man befo'
But you gon' be the first you little trick ass hoe
Then you can tell me just how it taste
But before I nut I shoot some piss in your face
You fuckin' coward, tremblin' like a nervous wreck

'Cause when I caught your ass, you put yourself in check
And when you left my presence, you left expedient
You ain't no fuckin' killer, youse a comedian, beyotch
Tell me why you act so scary
Givin' your set a bad name wit your misspelled name
E-I-H-T, now should I continue
Yeah you left out the G 'cause the G ain't in you
Remember that time you was rollin' on the West side
And a little brown bucket pulled up on your side

Caught at that light in your Camry in the midst of a
Real killer, tell me did you feel a little nervous
You was in the shadow of death with two trey-five-sevens
Pointed at your chest whatchu gon' do, where was your
Niggaz that kill at you ain't got no killers so kill dat
Holdin' up your hands and beggin' for a pass
You lucky they didn't just to get to dumpin' on yo' ass
'Cause this game you think is funny is some real shit
So you need to be more careful who you fuckin' wit, beyotch!

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
I'm through playin' with your punk ass
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense

And everthang is straight I'm in the full zone
Gettin paper every day, it's all I'm trippin on
Cause ain't nothin like a ride in Californ-ia
with the top back, rollin on a hot sunny day
It's one-oh, fo'-sho', and I'm clownin all the rookies
With a pocket full of cookies

Put it down anywhere, take thangs for what they worth
been a rider since birth, and the earth is my turf
So I bails in the party, everythang is cool
It's niggaz in the hood I ain't seen since high school
And everybody gots stripes cause we all paid dues
Crips, Damus, and other clicks and crews
Just gettin they boogie on, hoochie bitches gettin loose
It kinda remind me of the truce in nine-deuce
I'm even kickin back, and I'm usually chicken hawkin
The bloods shootin dice, and the crips are C walkin
Now the party is jumpin, and the crowd's gettin bigger
Looked up and saw four hoes to every nigga
And it's off the hook, got ya grindin and humpin
Cause the backyard boogie be bumpin

You can put that on yo' hood, everyday

You choose or you lose while you conversatin
enough cock to go around, so ain't no playa hatin
I want homegirl over there in red
cause Baby Got Backs like Mix-a-Lot said
When I keep my composure, kick back like a pro
Cause Mack one-oh just refuse to save a hoe
But it's a done deal, locked up throw away the key

But we gonna kick it like this on the last album

Now let me holler at ya partner, spit this game
In you ear for a minute, quit complaining
Bout how you can't spend it cause you ain't got it
You got what it takes but not enough to get started
I hope you get the message, no it's not a test it's
Just me ridin legit, they can't arrest me or bust me

I'm still hungry, I want some more stuff
Get fat and watch my whole crew blow up
So get yours, and buy my new album
Peep the game and don't be like Calvin
Get everything you want, get real, get you mail
Get your girl to make bail and get your ass out of jail

You should be gettin it, everything you want
Everything you dreamed of, never have to front
You should be gettin it, gettin money
I'm talking bout you black, don't laugh it ain't funny
You should get a good lawyer, like Johnny Cochran
Swear to tell the truth, hell no I didn't pop him

Get your kids in school, so they can get an education
Get a degree, and take a vacation
You see I got all my game from the streets of California
Young millionaire with no high school diploma
Livin' real good, taking care of my folks
Roll up a fat one for the players to smoke

Short dawg in the house, I know you ain't trippin
Cause life is too $hort you gotta get in where you fit in
Stop looking for what you never seem to find
It ain't what you think you got to read between the lines
Cause life ain't long, for a young black man
Tryin to make money doing all he can

Sellin' dope don't ya' hope he would go to class
But the boy makes money and he makes it fast
With the twenties on top and the fifties on the bottom
I fuck the top notches oh yes we got em
It's been a long time since I first got down
But I still keep makin' these funky sounds
Get your money man
Get yours

You should be gettin it
Get it while the gettin is good, get it while you can
You should be gettin it
Get it while the gettin is good

I know you tired of being broke just hanging out
You gotta lotta dreams but you can't get out
The first thing you need to do is set your self some goals
Think positive, everything else is old
And work hard, never stop hustlin'
'Cause they just love to see the black man strugglin'

It's time to come up, put your dollar bills in the air
He said meet me at the White House and I was there
'Cause I'm one in a million, black man rising
They wanna keep me down but I always surprise em
Spend my money in the hood, I know it's all good

And you should do the same I told you peep the game
Too $hort, you know I'm the man
I lend my brother a hand 'cause I know I can
I keep going and goin' but I'm not the pink bunny
I'm not beatin' on a drum I never stop thinkin' money
I'm gettin' all I can if you don't ya' slip

I can't wait to get to heaven just to have a grip
When I was broke, I couldn't afford a meal
But now I'm now rich I can't be fake I gots to keep it real
It's been a long time baby since I first got down
But it still keep making these funky sounds

You should be gettin it
Get it while the gettin is good, get it while you can
You should be gettin it
Get it while the gettin is good

Why do you like Cool J (it ain't Rock 'N' Roll)
'Cause it ain't the glory days with Bruce Springsteen
I'm not a virgin so I know I'll make Madonna scream
You hated Michael and Prince all the way, ever sense
If their beats were made of meat, then they would have to be mince

My posse's on Broadway

Me and Kid Sensation at home away from home
In the black Benz Limo with the cellular phone
I'm callin' up the posse it's time to get rippin'
A freak in each sunroof to keep you suckas trippin'

Everybody's lookin' if you're jealous turn around
The AMG kit keeps us closer to the ground
We're gettin' good grip from the 50 series tires
The Alpine's bumpin' but I need the volume higher

'Cause the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb
We're rollin' Rainier, and the jealous wanna get some
Every time we do, the sucka M.C.'s wanna battle
I'm the man they love to hate, the J.R. Ewing of Seattle

Picked up the posse on 23rd and Jackson
Headin' for the strip, yes we're lookin' for some action
The limo's kinda crowded, the whole car was leanin' back
Maharaji's watchin' TV with two girlies on his lap

On Martin Luther King, the set looks kinda dead
We need a new street so posse move ahead
We all look kinda' swass, the crew you can't forget
The Mix-A-Lot posse col' rippin' up the set

My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up!
My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway

Rollin' in my posse, was gettin' kinda' bored
There's not another posse with more points scored
We don't walk around like criminals or flex like big gorillas
My homeboy Kid Sensation is the teenage lady killa'

Maharaji's on the def side dancin' like a freak
The girlies see his booty and their knees get weak
Larry is the white guy people think he's funny
A real estate investa' who makes a lot of money

Clockin' lots of dollas' we all got gold
Cruzin' in this Benz ain't got no place to go
Wheelin' 23rd we saw nothin' but thugs
The girlies was too skinny from smokin' all them drugs

'Cause the rock man got 'em and their butts just dropped
The freaks looked depressed because our Benz won't stop
At 23rd and Union the driver broke left
Kevin shouted, Broadway it's time to get def

My girl blew me a kiss, she said I was the best
She's lookin' mighty freaky in her black silk dress
The closer that we get, the crazier that I feel
The posse's on Broadway it's time to get ill

My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

Cruzin' Broadway and my wheels spin slow
Rollin' with your posse is the only way to go
The girlies by the college was lookin' for a ride
We tried to pick 'em up but we had no room inside

We put 'em on the trunk, we put 'em on the hood
Some sat up with the driver they made him feel good
The posse's gettin' bigger, there's much too many freaks
The muffler's draggin', my suspension's gettin' weak

Now the posse's gettin' hungry, and Mix-A-Lot's treatin'
We stopped at Taco Bell, for some Mexican eatin'
But Taco Bell was closed, the girls was on my tip
They said, ""Go back the other way, we'll stop and eat at Dick's""

Dick's is the place where the cool hang out
The swass like to play, and the rich flaunt clout
Posse to the burger stand, so big we walk in twos
We're gettin' dirty looks, from those other sucka crews

Kid Sensation dropped a twenty, and didn't even miss it
Skeeza from anotha' crew, she picked it up and kissed it
Her boyfriend's illin', he went to slap her face
My homeboy P.L.B. col' sprayed the boy with mace

'Cause I never liked a punk, who beat up on his girl
If you don't have game, then let her leave your world
We took his girl with us, with him she rode the bus
She gave the boy the finga', and the sucka starts to cuss

Boy, I gotta def posse, you gotta bunch of dudes
You're broke col' cryin' 'bout the rock-man blues
You beat up on your girl, and now you're all upset
She's with the Mix-A-Lot posse, on the Broadway set

Heat don't work an' my girl keeps naggin'
Six-nine Buick, deuce keeps rollin'
One hubcap 'cause three got stolen
Bumper shook loose, chrome keeps scrapin'
Mis-matched tires, and my white walls flakin'
Hit mickey-d's, Maharaji starts to bug
He ate a quarter-pounder, threw the pickles on my rug
Runnin', movin' tabs expired
Girlies tryin' to dis 'n say my car looks tired
Hit my brakes, out slid skittles
Tinted back window with a bubble in the middle
Who's car is it? Posse won't say
We all play it off when you look our way
Rollin' four deep, tires smoke up the block
Gotta roll this bucket, 'cause my Benz is in the shop

My hooptie - my hooptie

Four door nightmare, trunk locks' stuck
Big dice on the mirror, grill like a truck
Lifters tickin', accelerator's stickin'
Somethin' on my left front wheel keeps clickin'
Picked up the girlies, now we're eight deep

Cars barely movin', but now we got heat
Made a left turn as I watched in fright
My ex-girlfriend shot out my headlight
She was standin', in the road, so I smashed her toes
Mashed my pedal, boom, down she goes
Law ain't lyin', long hairs flyin'
We flipped the skeez off, dumb girl starts cryin'
Baby called the cops, now I'm gettin' nervous
The cops see a beeper and the suckers might serve us
Hit a side street and what did we find?
Some young punk, droppin' me a flip off sign
Put the deuce in reverse, and started to curse
Another sucker on the south side about to get hurt
Homey got scared, so I got on
Yeah my group got paid, but my groups still strong
Posse moved north, headin for the CD
Ridin' real fast so the cops don't see me
Mis-matched tires got my boys uptight
Two Vogues on the left, Uniroyal on the right
Hooptie bouncin', runnin' on leaded
This is what I sport when you call me big-headed
I pot-hole crusher, red light rusher
Musher of a brother 'cause I'm plowin' over suckers

In a hooptie

It's a three-ton monster, econo-box stomper
Snatch your girly, if you don't I'll romp 'er
Dinosaur rush, lookin' like Shaft
Some get bold, but some get smashed
Cops say the car smokes, but I won't listen
It's a six-nine deuce, so the hell with emissions
Rollin' in Tacoma, I could get burned
(Sound of automatic gunfire) Betta make a you-turn
Spotted this freak with immense posterior
Tryin' to roll smooth through the Hilltop area
Brother start lettin' off, kickin' that racket
Thinkin' I'm a rock star, slingin' them packets
I ain't wit' dat, so I smooth eject
Hit I-5 with the dope cassette
Playin' that tough crew hardcore dope
The tape deck broke
Damn what's next, brothers in Goretex
Tryin' to find a spot where we could hunt for sex
Found a little club called the N-see-O
Military, competition. You know.
I ain't really fazed, 'cause I pop much game
Rolled up tough, 'cause I got much fame
""How ya doin' baby, my name is Mixalot""
""Mixalot got a Benz boy, quit smokin' that rock""
Ooooh, I got dissed. But it ain't no thing
Runnin' that game with the home made slang
Baby got ished, Bremelo gip.
Keep laughin' at the car and you might get clipped

By a hooptie

Runnin' outta gas, stuck in traffic
Far left lane, throwin' up much static
Input, output, carbeurator fulla soot
""Whatcha want me to do Mix?""
Push freak, push
Sputter, sputter rollin' over gutters
Cars dip low with hard core brothers
Tank on E, pulled into Arco
Cops on tip for Columbian cargo
We fit a stereotype, that's what he said
Big long car, four big black heads
Cops keep jockin', grabbin' like 'gators
'Bout stereotypes, I'm lookin' nuthin' like Noriega
Cop took my wallet, looked at my license
His partner said ""Damn, they all look like Tyson""
Yes, I'm legit, so they gotta let me go

Funky, funky ghetto
Trying to survive
Trying to stay alive

The ghetto
The ghetto (talking 'bout the ghetto)
The ghetto (hmm)
The ghetto (funky, funky ghetto)

Even though the streets are bumpy, lights burned out
Dope fiends die with a pipe in their mouths
Old school buddies not doing it right
Every day it's the same
And it's the same every night
I wouldn't shoot you, bro, but I'd shoot that fool
If he played me close and tried to test my cool
Every day I wonder just how I'll die
Only thing I know is how to survive
There's only one rule in the real world
And that's to take care of you, only you and yours
Keep dealing with the hard times day after day
Might deal me some dope, but then crime don't pay
Black man tried to break in my house again
Thought he got off the dope doing time in the pen
Even though my brothers do me just like that
I get a lot of love so I'm giving it back to the ghetto

The ghetto (talking 'bout the ghetto)
The ghetto (funky, funky ghetto)
The ghetto (trying to live our lives)
The ghetto (won't ya tell 'em 'bout it, Too $hort?)

So just peep the game and don't call it crap
'Cause to me, life is one hard rap
Even though my sister smoked crack cocaine
She was nine months pregnant, ain't nothing changed
600 million on a football team
And her baby died just like a dope fiend
The story I tell is so incomplete
Five kids in the house, no food to eat
Don't look at me and don't ask me why
Mama's next door getting high
Even though she's got five mouths to feed
She'd rather spend her money on a H-I-T
I always tell the truth about things like this
I wonder if the mayor overlooked that list
Instead of adding to the task force, send some help
Waiting on him, I'd better help myself
Housing authority and the O.P.D
All these guns just to handle me in the ghetto

The ghetto (people are dying)
The ghetto (children are crying)
The ghetto (don't have enough to eat)
The ghetto (don't even have shoes on their feet)
The ghetto

Even though they put us down and call us animals
We make real big banks and buy brand new clothes
Drive fancy cars, make love to stars
Never really saying just who we are
We use alias names like Too $hort
Sell you stuff you might kill for
Young kids grow up and that's all they know
Didn't teach him in school, now he's slangin' dope
Only thing he knows is how to survive
But will he kill another brother before he dies?
In the ghetto, you keep one eye open
All day long, just hoping and hoping
You can pay your bills and not drink too much
Then the problems of life you'll be throwing up
Like me, but you don't see
Ten years from now, where will you be?

The ghetto (talking 'bout the ghetto)
Trying to get out of the ghetto
The ghetto (talking 'bout the ghetto)
But I got no place to go
The ghetto (talking 'bout the ghetto)
Trying to survive in the heart of the ghetto
The ghetto (talking 'bout the ghetto)
Ha, 'cause that's the only place that I know

So much game in a Too $hort rap
Can't be white and whites can't be black
Why you wanna act like someone else?
All you gotta do is just be yourself
We're all the same color underneath
Short dog is in the house you'd better listen to me
Never be ashamed of what you are
Proud to be black, stand tall at heart
Even though some people give you no respect
Be intelligent, when you put 'em in check
'Cause when you're ignorant, you get treated that way
And when they throw you in jail, you got nothing to say
So if you don't listen, it's not my fault
I'll be getting paid and you'll be paying the cost
Sitting in the jailhouse, running your mouth
While me and my people try to get out

Talking 'bout the ghetto
The ghetto (talking 'bout the ghetto)

The ghetto (talking 'bout the ghetto)

The ghetto (talking 'bout the ghetto)
Trying to stay alive

She had a girlfriend, her name was Vicki
I pulled her to the side and let her suck my dick.
She was fine as fuck, but can't fuck with Tina
Tina, Tina, the sperm cleana.
I took her to my house and told her strip
Baby got freaky-started doing the splits.
I said, ""Bitch! You can do what you want
Cause this true blue mack won't even front"".
I fucked her with my finger, she tried to cum
Pussy so tight, it wouldn't give me none
I'm Sir Too $hort baby couldn't be no punk
I'm trying to get freaky cause I love the funk
My dick is big and her nigga had a little one,
I didn't fuck her freaky ass, but it was still fun.

It's the California lifestyle that I live.

Hella freaky, won't say no for shit
You and her all alone, nigga that's your bitch.

'cause it had to be a crime to be that dumb
I took her to my house and she let me cum in her mouth
You know I did all that shit
She got my number, if she beep me, I'm gonna call that bitch,
And go dig in them guts like a gardener,
If she starts screamin', I'm gonna fuck the bitch harder.

Cause these are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales I tell so well
You don't like my dirty rap you can go to hell
'cause Short Dogg's on the mike tellin' cocktails.

I meet the groupies, hookers like Kathy,
Fucking M.C.'s cause she's so nasty,
See her backstage trying to throw that ass,
She just like the freaks and she had to pass me that pussy
You can't stop the bitch
Let her roll on my rolls then I drop the bitch
My name is Short my game is long
I freak these hoes and sing these songs.
I know another girl named Stephanie
Do anything she can to have sex with me
She really don't bring out the best in me
But I love her fine ass laying next to me.
She's like another freak named Nicole
So damn sprung on my diamonds and gold
I took her to my house, she gave me the panties
I fucked her so good she told her friend named Angie.
Angie called me up about two weeks later
Talking some shit about do me player
So I did her just like Tamara,
Taking naked pictures with my Polaroid camera.
Next they told a girl named Rocquelle
Got my skin all under her fingernails
She was diggin' in my back while I grind the shit
That was way back now I can't find the bitch
But if I do, I'll probably do the same again
Break the bitch for everything 'cause I came to pimp.
I'm Too Short baby, I don't stop mackin'
I grab the microphone and I don't stop rappin'
You can bet your life as I spit these raps
I'll be fucking em' up like that, bitch.

No rapper can rap quite like I can
I'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand
Not the last Mafioso, I'm a MC cop
Make you say, ""Go LL"" and do the Wop
If you think you can out rhyme me, yeah, boy, I bet
'Cause I ain't met a motherfucker who can do that yet
Trendsetter, I'm better, my rhymes are good
I got a gourmet plate that says ""I wish you would""
And when battles begin then I gotta join in and
Before my rhyme is over, you know I'ma win

Ask anybody in the crowd, they say the kid don't play

Caught in the middle and
Not surrenderin'
I don't rhyme for the sake of of riddlin'
Some claim that I'm a smuggler
Some say I never heard of 'ya
A rap burglar, false media
We don't need it do we?
It's fake that's what it be to 'ya, dig me?
Don't believe the hype

Don't believe the hype, its a sequel
As an equal, can I get this through to you
My 98's boomin' with a trunk of funk
All the jealous punks can't stop the dunk
Comin' from the school of hard knocks
Some perpetrate, they drink Clorox
Attack the black, 'cause I know they lack exact
The cold facts, and still they try to Xerox
Leader of the new school, uncool
Never played the fool, just made the rules
Remember there's a need to get alarmed
Again I said I was a timebomb
In the daytime the radio's scared of me
'Cause I'm mad, plus I'm the enemy
They can't c'mon and play with me in primetime
'Cause I know the time, plus I'm gettin' mine
I get on the mix late in the night
They know I'm livin' right, so here go the mike, sike
Before I let it go, don't rush my show
You try to reach and grab and get elbowed
Word to herb, yo if you can't swing this
Just a little bit of the taste of the bass for you
As you get up and dance at the LQ
When some deny it, defy if I swing bolos
Then they clear the lane I go solo
The meaning of all of that
Some media is the whack
You believe it's true, it blows me through the roof
Suckers, liars get me a shovel
Some writers I know are damn devils
For them I say don't believe the hype
Yo Chuck, they must be on a pipe, right?
Their pens and pads I'll snatch
'Cause I've had it
I'm not an addict fiendin' for static
I'll see their tape recorder and grab it
No, you can't have it back silly rabbit
I'm going' to my media assassin
Harry Allen, I gotta ask him
Yo Harry, you're a writer, are we that type?
Don't believe the hype
I got flavor and all those things you know
Yeah boy, part two bum rush and show
Yo Griff, get the green black red and
Gold down countdown to Armageddon
88 you wait the S1Ws will
Rock the hard jams, treat it like a seminar
Teach the bourgeois, and rock the boulevard
Some say I'm negative
But they're not positive
But what I got to give

Your party is bogus, Yo it ain't legit
You better put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded

Get it started!

Now get up out your seat because my beat is so complete
I'm movin everybody from A to Z
And when it comes to straight up rockin, I'm second to none
From Doug E. Fresh to LL or DJ Run

Sippin' pints of ale out the window sill
When I get my fill I'm chilly chill

Now, I just got home because I'm out on bail
What's the time? It's time to buy ale
Peter eater, parking meter all of the time
If I run out of ale, it's Thunderbird wine

Miller drinkin', chicken eatin', dress so fly

I'm a peep-show seekin' on the Forty-deuce
I'm a killer at large and I'm on the loose
Pistol packin', Monkey drinkin', no money bum
I come from Brooklyn 'cause that's where I'm from

Everyday I drink O.E. and I don't go to work
You drippy nose knuckle-head, you're wet behind the ears

Chef Boyardee coolin' on the pot

And I'm never dusting out 'cause I torch that crack

You mad 'cause your daughter fuck with me on spring break
Well, I'ma fuck her 'til the springs break

Yeah, roll another one 'cause I'm winning
In my four-door looking real photogenic
Gentleman attire, in threads that won't expire
I'm in a class of my own, my teacher got fired
Money getting long, pussy rate keep rising
Versace outfit cost me three thousand
From the P houses, did it from the wee hours
Selling that chicken no lemon pepper, no sweet and sour

First you get the power, then you get respect
I'm getting so much money I can buy ya bitch
Take it how you wanna, if you wanna take it
I like clubs where all the women working naked
Fell in love with a waitress what the fuck I'm thinking
Bought that hoe a ring, it was for her pinky
Uh, that's pimpin' that's slick
Got a bottle of cologne that cost more than your rent

Fuck y'all mad at me for
Got a black card, and a black Phantom
With a white bitch in Idaho, I do the same thing in (Montana)
Got a thick bitch in Atlanta, got a redbone in the Chi

Got coke swimming in that glass jar, bitch go turn on them burners
Got dope to sell in this hotel, no half price, no retail

You a bitch nigga, no female, I smack niggas, Sprewell

Humble yourself, you not a G, keep it one with yourself
Run to niggas for help, favors I keep one on the shelf
I got rifles with lasers, swing it just like the majors
Hit you right above navel, now you swimming in pavement

Gold medals on my neck, I call it Michael Phelps
Hoes settling for less, I call 'em bottom shelf

On the road to the riches, bitches not tagging along

Unless it's ass in a thong, hit that ass and I'm gone

If you got work, go to work, don't work at your residence

Riding through the jungles in that motherfuckin' elephant
That's a gray ghost, with the ears on it
Swimming through the hood like it got fins on it (tell 'em)

851,Happy Birthday,Flipsyde (MN),"Please accept my apologies, wonder what would have been
would you have been a little angel? or an angel of sin?
tom-boy running around, hanging with all the guys?
or a little tough boy with beautiful brown eyes?
paid for the murder befor they had determined the sex
choosing our life over your life meant your death
and you never got a chance to even open your eyes
sometimes I wonder as a fetus if you fought for your life?
Would you have been a little genius, in love with math?
Would you have played in your school clothes and made me mad?
would you have been a little rapper like your poppa the piper?
would you have made me quit smoking by finding one of my lighters?
I wonder about your skintone and shape of your nose
and the way you would have laughed and talked fast or slow
I think about it every year, so I picked up a pen
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would have been

Happy birthday
What I thought was a dream
make a wish
was as real as it seemed

I made a mistake

I got a million excuses, as to why you died
and other people got their own reasons for homocide
who's to say it would have worked
and who's to say it wouldn't have
I was young and struggling, but old enough to be a dad
the fear of being my father has never disappeared
I ponder it frequently while I'm sipping on my beer
my vision of a family was artificial and fake
so when it came time to create I made a mistake
now you got a little brother, maybe it's really you
maybe you really forgave us knowing we was confused
maybe, every time that he smiles
it's you proudly knowing that your father is doing the right thing now
I never tell a woman what to do with her body
but if she don't love children then we can't party
I think about it every year so I picked up a pen
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would have been

Happy birthday
What I thought was a dream
make a wish
was as real as it seemed

I made a mistake

from the heavens to the womb
to the heavens again
from the ending to the ending
never got to begin
maybe one day we can meet face to face
in a place without time and space
happy birthday

Happy birthday
What I thought was a dream
make a wish
was as real as it seemed

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck
But, homie, ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit' a few shells, but I don't walk wit' a limp (I'm ight)

In the hood, in L.A., they saying ""50 you hot""
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla, in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold
I'm full of focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill' out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shorty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex I, ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't change

And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back, right?
When my jaws get to bumpin' in the club it's on
I wink my eye at you, bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If the talk ain't 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me, ""Cuz, go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head wit' a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love

Wish I was Jigga man, carefree living
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louie
I'm the Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
You know how I be when you start livin' large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram'
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself, why he by himself?
He got two older brothers, one hood, one good
An independent older sister got me fly when she could
But they all didn't see,
The little bit of sadness in me, Scotty

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you
It's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life (yeah, yeah)
The soundtrack to my life

I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of 'shrooms just so I could see the universe
I tried to think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room and soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancun
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try to shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand, fam'

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you
It's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life
The soundtrack to my life

I was close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slitting my throat
Ignorance the cope man
Ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love, and I need that shit
If I never did shows, then I'd probably be a myth
If I cared about the blogs, then I'd probably be a jack-ass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see thirty
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down, pussy and some Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you
It's only right

(I reminisce, I reminisce)
Yeah
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)

I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
22 years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the eighth of October
A toast but my granddaddy came sober
Countin' all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose, you hope the little black boy grows, huh
18 years younger than my mama
But I really got beatings 'cause the girl loved drama

In single parenthood there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one's a girl, let's name her Pam
Same father as the first but you don't give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not thinking
Papa said, ""Chill"" but the brother keep winking
Still he won't down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide

But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After ten years without no spouse
Momma's gettin' married in the house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother queen's risin' a chapter
Déjà vu, tell you what I'm gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my God

My God
It's so, yeah, so lovely
That's how we like to do it in the 90's
Pete Rock and CL Smooth comin' atcha

When I date back, I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand, Poppa Doc, I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother
Taking care of this so who am I to bicker?
Not a bad ticker but I'm clocking pop's liver
But you can never say that his life is through
Five kids at 21, believe he got a right too

Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portuguese lover at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough, they live longer than us
Never been senile, that's where you're wrong
But give the man a taste and he's gone
Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room

I get the pillow and hope I don't wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Tellin' me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over
I said pop maybe when you're older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing yelling good God, Almighty
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real

For real, baby like that we for real
Comin' atcha in '92
Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Yeah, c'mon, hit me

I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of way back, so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the R-O-Y, how did you and I meet?
In front of Big Lou's, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me

Rain or shine, yes in any weather
My grandmom Pam holds the family together
My uncle Doc's the greatest, better yet the latest
If we're talking about a car, uncle Sterling got the latest

I strive to be live 'cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my aunt Joyce
So Pete Rock hit me, nuff respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen

Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that's word is bond
I'm not playin'
Everybody, just coolin'
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another

'Cause I'm KRS, and I'm on the mic, and Premier's on The Breaks

Goin' out to the hardcore hip hop
Goin' out to the hardcore hip hop
Of course we don't flip flop

If you don't know me by now, I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go, ""Ill""
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, as I leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber

Clapper, down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or knotty dreads
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Want to kick rhymes off the top of they head

Word, what go around come around, I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember You Must Learn
About the styles I flip and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player
But make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer

MC's act like they don't know

MC's act like they don't know

MC's act like they don't know

This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see, then ya saw, I'm in your grill with mad skill
MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow, let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know

Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent

I'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
When I rock and shock and hip hop, it unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it

I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew, they start bitchin'

I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tango with the likes of these
Cross your T's and dot your I's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like Artifacts
On the Wrong Side of Da Tracks, electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism

No way, you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I'll break it
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under
Their noses, I hate those motherfuckin' posers
But I'm so real to them it's scary
And with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me
And no, we don't make wack tracks
And all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin' real facts
I represent, set up shit like a tent, boy
You're paranoid 'cause you're a son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

But I get props like a slogan
And no man could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connectin', complete mic wreckin'
No double checkin', vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to, I go all out with no mic
Yeah, that's right, 'cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps I truly care
'Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel

Just like the seashore, I'm calm
But wild, with my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Gimme a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond, I go on and on
For you it's tragic, I got magic like wands

Wanna talk dough? I'm seein' more cash than a bank teller
Wanna talk girls, you can't follow this

Moms kicked me out the house when I was flippin' I'm the man
Put the boys on the street, make them walk this beat
Teach them how to eat, and to seek for peace

Son I stamped this name livin' proof 'cause I mean what I say
Bring the fake to reality and make them pay
Yo these ghetto rhyme stories got em scared to death
I'm tryin to get the fuck out, see what the worlds about
Check it nineteen-eighty-six is when I reached my peak
Take my brothers outta state and tried to make some ends meet

First destinate your sector then it's just like that
Makin' moves with my brothers and there's no turnin back
We got thirty-six grams on the scale right now
Gettin' ready with my brothers time to break the shit down
I'm not about killin my people but you know how it go
Work with me not against me and well make mad dough

Wear my co-defendant out when I break down with rap
Hold me back and give me love and now I'm givin' it back
A unique sound from the streets and it's just so sweet
My livin' proof life story, let me break it in piece

Yo I rock on the block with the real hip-hop
As you start to clock... and jock
Yo, I'm comin' off with mad rage
Eighteen, and hittin' the real stage

But don't worry bout me, 'cause I'm makin' it
And if I can't have it, then I'm takin' it
Thats how it is, 'cause I'm livin' trife
Where's my knife, take a chance witcha life

Rappers decapitate, and disintegrate
You I will mutilate, when I penetrate
Go for the one when I say raid
A hit man for hire and I wanna get paid
Cause bullets are sprayed and anybody is laid
More money is made and that's the family trade
See I make moves and tell whats the truth
That's why I'm here, to be livin' proof

Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough

I'm lost, must pay the cost to be the boss
With force, rather get my point across
I'm goin off on the mic insane, out of sight
When I take flight (like who kid?) like Mike
And you see, I be rollin like a battlecat
And I'm ready to rip on my combat
Beef I'm not havin' that yo, I pull my trigger back
And all you pussy niggaz know where my heart is at
I like to stay down low but yo I flip at times
Like when I'm kickin' lines, or bustin' out nines
It's like that, shit I jumped off the roof
Pysch, 'cause I wouldn't be livin proof

Kick the truth, to the young black youth

The moral of the story - what the fucks goin on?
Nyceez won't see two thousand if these niggaz keep frontin
I used to hustle on the block, now I rock for papes
Watch out, the world turn, and I will come back
Relieven' stress off my brain I got the la-la for that
Breakin' down all subjects, and then all facts
Lettin' lose everyday, but still, keepin' it fat
Bust it niggaz keep on frontin' in this game aight?
Scared to death ass rappers don't get no props
Scared to come to the ghetto talk about bustin shots
See I can walk around the ghetto stand in peace and at ease
Get my ghetto crowd open yo you know what I mean
Indeed, see what I see and then you know what I mean
Gettin' ready for the future so don't fuck with me
My livin' proof life story niggaz I kill it with ease

Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof

We were misunderstood, last time we brought you
Ba Bichez (Da Bichez Da Bichez)
Now we gonna clear it up and let you make up your own mind
Like this...
Now a queen's a queen, and a whore is a whore
She felt if she made me wait I'd have more respect for her
Adore her, eventually spendin up my digits
She felt that love would make me buy her mad material shit
She likes to trick em, cause ain't nothin like a sleepin victim
East New York style stick em -- ha ha ha, stick em
Top rated game, but if it's game I played it
Underestimated, swore the king was checkmated
She claims she loves my mind, cause I'm so intelligent
But fuck my mental, she was scheming on my mint
Evil inten-tion, to de-plenish the fund
She tried to juice me with the pussy cept for, the mask and gun
I was a fool to fall in lust with this evil ge-nius
She had me by the nuts
She ain't got shit but man she loves it plush
Whippin I whip, and suckin up I canibus
Back in the days, I woulda scraped her for this caper
But I realize, it wasn't me it was the paper
Let me kick it, about the digits, that I've collected
Long distance, and disconnected, it's gettin hectic
Before my record, they didn't show it
But now they throw it, hopin that they'll get drunk off Moet
Or Cristal, but that's not my par-ticular style and taste
My name ain't Puff and I ain't got loot to waste
I ain't got time to waste, bad bitches is all up in my face
Crazy ignorant, sweatin links minks and shit
Cosmetic, but deep down, derelict
Fake players, never get out the projects
It's pathetic -- the way she bends for dividends
I tried to jewel her but she tried to get a drink at the end
Of our con-vo-sation, I did not have the patience
Slid off to the next Asian
She said, ""What you do?"" I said, ""What?""
She said, ""You know your occupation?""
So I broke the fuck out
In nineteen-ninety-six that's what it's all about, but
I won't go that route
Back in the days Biz said it was The Vapors
But today, I realize that it's the papers
""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""
""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""
""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""
Now a whore's a whore, find a queen and she'll be my Earth
Respect love and protect her, for all that it's worth
I admit I have flaws, I flips it first, but deep down
I wishes to give em the universe
A lot of the ones that I thought was right wasn't
I build with Afu, he said ""Don't sweat it cause
They come a dime a dozen""
Like my ex-stunt, wanted a diamond
Bitches love power, while queens, love refinement
Low stress environment, old age and retirement
Never have to wonder where my money went
Where my honey went, is her back gettin twisted
By the next fella, always take heed to what I tell her
When I'm wrong, she lets me know I need correction
When I'm right she's my reflection still we, use protection
Through thick and thin, thin and thick
She's my diamond in the rough not a whore or a trick
Great expectations, of me and she buildin nation
Everything we do and skyscrapin
Back in the days, the devil used to rape her
Nowadays, he got her chasin the paper
""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""

Where's the iggity? The bum siggity
Niggas wanna know but check the flow my little chickadee
I'm comin' with the Books and kid it looks like it's a winner
Ya better get'cha plate because I'm servin' raps for dinner
See I freak it from the sewer plus I'm quick to do ya posse
I swoop in on the loop just like I was a kamikaze
See they thought I lost my spot
So they went and got real comfy
So now I gotta hit 'em hard and Bogart, like Humphrey
Ya hypocrite, I'm rippin' it because I'm flyer
You're phony, full of bologna like Oscar Mayer
See I attack a pack of rappers just for practice
I bust my tactics, I'm sharper than a, cactus

One two (set it off)

Yo it's the Books in reverse
The next kid up sendin' a big-up to my borough
I'm thorough, breded in the ghetto from a teenie bop
Takin' lessons, sweatin' niggas on graffiti rock
And now the slang bringer bring a thing of interpretations
My nerves is achin', see I'm sick of niggas perpetratin'
But can't see this, I'm screamin' on their records like Beavis
Or Butthead, I bust heads like Amy
Fisher, it's a
Pisser, hit you like an accident
And if I'm in your town
You might peep me at the Radisson
Or splatterin', batterin' crews for lip chatterin'
It ain't nothing new
That's how we do, my crew is back again

Back in effect, how's that?
(People, people, people, people) Back in effect, how's that?
(People, people, people, people) Back in effect, how's that?
Just when you thought it was safe
(People, people, people, people) Back in effect, how's that?
(And yo I still wanna battle)

Well here I go again, so check the flow again
Try not to bite
I'll fake a nigga with my left and then
I (fling) him with my right
I'm outta sight, look how I do it
Ya blew it if you dissed a
Nigga on the microphone 'cause I can bone your sister
Word is bond, I'm on some new, do, like this
Grab the piece of steel and shoot the gift like Kris
Kringle, bust my jingle, don't it make ya shiver?
Give a nigga what he needs so he can bleed when I deliver (what? Nigga)
A microphone check, what the heck?
I threw that in because I used to catch wreck
With it, that's the time I, hack-too, spit it
For Christ's sakes I meant it
Hit the brakes and you skidded
You, my style you bit it
But y'all can keep that
'Cause now I'm on some other type of flow
And best believe that

And all that, small cat, my format's deranged
Honey I'm back to run things
'Cause some things just never changed, punk
So if you're drunk, I freak the funk until you're sober
But still be gettin' chills when niggas play ""The Bridge is Over""
Kickin' the flam yo it's the man, tick tock, I jam like gridlock
My style is fender bendin' sendin' rappers to the pit stop
Good Lord ah mercy, hit reverse G if you missed it
And bust my gift of speech
'Cause like the priest, baby I'm twisted
Kid I swing a dome-buster like Bonecrusher Smith
Bust up your lips then puff up a spliff
So yo, who be dat that
That wanna do me back? Just to get
Booby trapped, jacked
'Cause my crew be strapped fat like that

Back in effect, how's that?
Word up

881,For Pete’s SakePete Rock & CL SmoothMecca and the Soul Brother1992Hip-Hop/Rap,Pete Rock & CL Smooth,"Here come's the rugged one, plus the way I flip it
I collect the loot and then I knock the boots
A smooth dark lover, prefer to be called the chocolate lover
Cuz I can do wonders under cover
I'm dip-dip-dope, I rhyme like riz-ope
I cleanse like soap, cause it's the great black hope
Stay away from the penile, I can rock the senile
Hons always wave cause slick like blue nile
Pete Rock on the boot knock, on the boot knock
Plus the way that I flow blood clot

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah
So funky, like a street junky
Like I said before, here we go, c'mon
For Pete's sake I break and update, wait, I radiate
The dub played to navigate the tune I make
I fit like a slipper, so catch the Big Dipper
Vital signs are quicker, not the flat line picture
Showtime original, official with the smooth criminal
I hit the cliches on the subliminal
With the soul technician to fill the prescription
In addition listen close to the mission
The P.E.T.E.R.O.C.K., resume
With the route to Brut by Faberge
No doubt, to shout about a 20-bar segment
Off spring the lyrics when the microphone's pregnant
Give it a rubdown, now here's the sermon
Everywhere you go you hear Mecca from the Vernon
Pound for pound, uptown, I get down
And bound to spin the record like a merry-go-round
The cut don't flow that I touch is not a preemie
And who would ever see me when I dream of Jeanie
I don't think so, peace, I gotta go
And shake like an earthquake, cousin, for Pete's sake

To my man

Here come's the rugged one, plus the way I flip it
I collect the loot and then I knock the boots
A smooth dark brother, prefer to be called the chocolate lover

I cleanse like soap, cause it's the great black hope
Stay away from the penile, I can rock the senile
Hons always wave cause I'm slick like lunile
Pete Rock on the boot knock, on the boot knock
Plus the way that I flow blood clot
Yo, my style's cock-diesel and I can do the hustle
Niggas know the time, I don't have to flex a muscle
I'm not the type to fake it, I wouldn't try to take it
Tie your girl to the back of my Jeep butt-naked
Slide her monkey ass down the hill
So if you don't want beef, money, chill for Pete's sake

To my man

Music please

The Mecca's sweet like nectar, maybe cause you need it
There's a ribbon in the sky, but I wonder if you see it
In the days of thunder, notice how I suplex in the proper context
Here steps the one, the answer to the riddle
Survey says the black press can make you wiggle
The staff to the craft, the stroke of a pena
Perfect stranger, melody arranger
Loopholes are filled when I build with the skill
Liquid steels the mic on the Rock's chill
No financial aid wade when I'm paid
Deep as the Everglade, the escapade a renagade
Study in the archives, place your bet, sonny
Head crack back to back for the bail money
For you, a chapter, slayed by the author
Lickin' on your daughter, say, south of the border
Now, here we are with the funky repertoire
Draw warm like a spa, star, forget all the hoopla

We got Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth
And we're here to tell you to
And that's a fact, baby
Now you're gonna kick some lyrics
Like this, c'mon

Walk the fine, short line, and put the needle to the grind
Representin' one kind, seeing eye for the blind
Witness what I carry on bears a further purpose
From how we do slam a few, then you want to purchase
A dialogue of funk, you love to pop it in your trunk
I win, more disciplined than a Show-lin monk
Pete Rock and C.L., well set to spark it
The powerful target to destroy the black market
But when you say black, listen, I don't know, you lose me
I guess another beggar can afford to be choosey
I come to the maximum, artist on a major label
Any duplication of this one is fatal
On one to five, I gotta hit ya live
Beat your ass with my tape, any race or shape
Cuz if they got mine, they got yours too
But together here's what we gotta do

Tell 'em straighten it out
Ah, yeah straighten it out
You know this is the word (say what?) straighten it out
That's right y'all straighten it out (say what?)
You got to straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out yeah
Straighten it out it's like that (say what?)

The funk legacy I pass on, clearancy for high rates
Every time we sample all the past time greats
Stick it in the SP-1200 beat, I make a loop
Lovely, where the Troop in a Lexus coupe
Just a little bit, set to make a whole lot happen
The musical inside my rappin'
Written by the C.L., produced by the P.R
And add in any credit that you heard thus far
I start from scratch, cuz the bass line's critical
Better than the original who first made it
But now you want to sue me, but fans never boo me
Believe I know the times, we been broke, too, G
Here's another sample clear, seeya, get the hell outta here
Like a bootleg, you're over for the year
You'll only get the credit where the credit is due
So, listen, what I shout out is true

Yeah, true straighten it out
You gots to tell 'em to straighten it out
(Say what?) straighten it out
You got to tell 'em to straighten it out
(Say what?) straighten it out
That's right straighten it out
C'mon (say what?) straighten it out
That's right straighten it out
Straighten it out (say what?)

Like the strands of lamb's wool, I'm thinkin' that's said
Here to go to the head and count the locks on a dred
I and I'd 'mit to verify, goin' to multiply
A theory many thought a conspiracy
Here to let you know that it applies to all of us
You're no exceptions to the rule and that's a plus
Cause who Jah bless, let no one curse
Straighten out what I be about, reckon above the clout
And let the management work for me
Because I don't need the unnecessary hostility
A proper marketing plan so we can gobble up the dough
Straighten it out, so everybody know
The kids are official with the purpose of a smooth surface
Kickin' the service one time to make 'em nervous
We're finally here and very long overdue
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew

You gotta straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out (say what?)
You gotta straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out you got to
Straighten it out c'mon (say what?)
Straighten it out
All black people must straighten it out
Say what?
Straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out
The YG's, they must straighten it out
The Hilltop, they muststraighten it out
The whole money-earnin' must straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out

Drinking Hen' and the harder you dance

Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah

Dancin', dancin' dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop pop pop like Pepsi Coke, the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get
Bustin' wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered

Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space
We can shoot up by the town
Have you ever been to Texas?
South By Southwest
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted

I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing
But no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands
Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things

Which your may think that shit insane
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain)
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?

Half a mill for the charm, nigga this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a young'n, was too much to cope with
Why you think mu'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit

Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we, walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin'

You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit

Cause half these rappers they Blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm gon' hurt ya

Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up

If you got diamonds and they shining throw your wrist up!

Hey hey
It's Luda Luda get it right I'm Mr. Money Machine
And I'm steady looking for two women I can come in between
You can catch me chilling up in the cut but I'm always ready for action
I'm stunt, like Jackie Chan and lay low, like {?} Jack-son
Maxing and relaxing, haters, do they really want to test me man
I got an arsenal waiting, do they really want to catch me man
No, I, don't, think, so
I've, got killers on the pay-roll if there's a, problem then say-so
I, make dough until there's none left
I run with plenty gangs that's holding things
And rearrange your frame in one breath
So to keep on breathing I suggest you take this beating

So I'm flocking 'em in, 'til the drop top is rocking again
Boy I got it locked, if you think not, then you'll get popped in the chin
And I'm clocking these ends, my record sales are blocking 'em in
Gotta thank those blessed to walk the streets to those that's locked in the pen

I'm so far ahead it's only RIGHT for you to hate on me man
When I'm pushing 90 by myself up in the H.O.B. lane
They trying to figure how many mo' women that I can take on my plane
Being one of the few rappers responsible for changing the game
Now desperate artists trying to sue but they just making some claims
Can't get in the spotlight for nothing and it just makes 'em insane
That's why some of the niggas resort right back to baking that 'caine
And selling it off to junky monkeys who keep baking they brain
As they grow older they'll be feeling a lot of aching and pain
So right at the head they might as well just be aiming that thing
And you ain't helping the process out by always caking these dames
But it is hard giving up the place where they be shaking they things

All over the world baby, it's only right that I share my experiences with y'all
Cause I've been places where you'll never imagine, but I'ma start at home
When I see a girl I like
I walk straight up to them and I'm like

Hey girl how ya doing
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name
If you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange, hey!
See I'm the man of this town
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinking of me
We got people to meet and many places to see, hey!
I'm really digging ya lips
But be careful where you walking when you swinging them hips
I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causing a crash
Wit ya traffic jam booty, heads pausing so fast, hey!
I wouldn't trade you for the world I swear it
I like ya hair and every style that ya wear it
And how the colors coordinate wit ya clothes
From your manicured nails to ya pedicured toes

Don't always think I'm trying to get in your pants
'Cause see me my pimpin's in 3-D
I'm taking you places you only see on T.V.
Trying to show ya that living is trife
How many guys you know that can bring the travel channel to life
One day we on the auto-bind swerving driving
Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands
If you with me ain't no time to sleep
Especially at wet willies on Miami Beach
But I drive you off and pay you no attention
If I make it to Atlanta's Brina Brothers convention
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours
Making sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard
Hawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see
So if yo ass don't show up it's more women for me, hey!

You know who we are, 'cause we pimping all over the world

You know who we are, 'cause we pimping all over the world

I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican day parade
Than at night I'm in New Orleans drinking hand Grenades
Outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest
In Mardi Gras all the women trying to show more they chest
Hey I'm in Jamaica spending massive bucks
While the ladies all begging me to masha tucks
I had sad beginnings when I rap wit no fans
Now it's all happy endings in my lap in Japan, hey
I used to think that it was way too cold
'Til I went to Canada and say some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribbean every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago
Oh yet and still you wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil
Ain't no need of even asking brah
The best women all reside in Africa, and that's real

Could we have all the real pimps
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air
Now ladies look around wit me
Lets see if we can weed some of these niggas out
'Cause it's no way that all these niggas could be pimpin', no
If you happen to see a nigga wit two sweat patches up under his arms
Look like he been swimming in shoulder height water
Please tell that nigga, put yo hands down
If you smell like you been at work all day and your car
Please put your hands down
Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his
Hands and lotion three quarters of his body
Please say put yo hands down
If yo spinning rims spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin'
If you are dancing on the dance floor and you look to yo left and yo right
And you do not see a woman in sight
Guess what you guessed it you are not
Pimpin', if your vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't Order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass
Put your hands down, now look down
I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time ok

'Til all this black on black crime stop
Some say the blind lead the blind
But in the ghetto you never know
When it's gon be yo time

Sitting in the ghetto thinkin' 'bout
All my homies passed away (uuunnnggghhh!)
Candy painted Cadillacs and triple gold
That's how me and my boys rolled
How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
My best friend's gone
And I'm so all alone
And I really miss my homies
Even though you're gone away
I know you're in a better place
And I hope to see you soon someday

I used to hang with my boy, even slang with my boy
I used to bang with my boy, goddamn I miss my boy
We started out youngstas in the park throwin' birds
In your hearse, damn it's sad to see my nigga in the dirt
The game got me workin', got me perkin', never jerkin'
Still blowin' dolja fo' ya 'cause I know you're up there workin'
Your little baby's cool and ya baby's mama straight
But today's a sad day to see your t-shirts with your face
From the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall
In the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall
In the projects you's a legend, on the street you was a star
But it's sad to see my homeboy ridin' in that black car
A lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried
You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire
Why soldiers ride for yo name, leave it vain
Some Gs never change, damn they killed you for some change
Smile for my homie Kevin Miller my boy Randall
The ghetto persons that lost their loved ones to these ghetto scandals

Take a minute to smile for the dead (uuunnnggghhh!)
Smile for the dead (RIP 2Pac, Makaveli)

Even though they gone away

I know you in a better place

And I hope to see ya soon someday
(And I keep smilin, knowin I'm a see you in the crossroads]

We used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys
But I'd give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy
Off in the club smokin' weed 'til 3, hollerin' at the hoes
Spendin' $4000 on me on gators and clothes
When I turned to rap, he had to chase the game
Nigga told me, ""C, leave that dope, 'cause rappin' is yo thang""
I ain't gon' even lie, some nights I ride and cry
Wonderin' why the real niggas always the ones to die
So I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind
I wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time
I wonder if there's a heaven up there for real Gs
For all the niggas in the game that be sellin' ki's
I keep my memories, try to keep my head strong
But baby it's hard to be strong, when yo main homie gone

Even though you gone away
(Even though you gone, you ain't never gon' be forgotten)
I know you in a better place
('Cause as long as I'm here
You gon' live through me and other TRU playas)
I really miss my homies
Even though their gone away
I know you in a better place
And I hope to see ya soon someday

I'm just sittin' here dazed thinkin' about all the times we had
Thinkin' about the past, some was good and some was bad
Remember Dante? It was a group of us, just a group of five
Now three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive
To all my soldiers before me, may y'all rest in peace
When He took three, took my soul, just the bodies
He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me
Wishin' I could rewind time like demos
Me and you gettin' girls, writin' down numbers like memos
Makin' million dollar bets, makin' all our money stretch like limos
Even though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry
But if I close my eyes and visualize me together then I suddenly wanna smile
See you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up
You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us
Even though you was wrong, I never could believe that that was true
You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos
See me and P and C forever gon be ridin' and thuggin'
Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it
And rest in peace to my brother
We gon' miss you

I know you in a better place
(Every time I get on my knees)
And I hope to see ya soon someday

With the attitude of not givin a fuck
Born with no luck, refuse to stay stuck

Did what I had to, I did what I could
My rise to the top was no surprise 'cause I knew dat I would
make it, oh, the chance I had to take it
Fake it, never

Fool, you think black nigga don't go for no losses

Down wit neighbourhood bouncers I made a connection in rows
Laid up with elbows in vogues

Round and round and round we go, a diff'rent day, a diff'rent face
Damn I wish I could run away, I hate this motherfuckin place
Too many goddamn rules that's why I quit school
Givin me a quickie test, I ain't no damn fool
Can't walk out my house because they always in my face
And if I step outta place, they want to give me a case
Ain't no difference between society and a jail house
Everybody's locked up and want to get the hell out
Just 'cause you ain't locked down you think you got it good
but you better think again 'cause the police are checkin niggas in the
neighbourhood
beatin our ass down
'cause society is just like the pen so get ready for the lock-down
Clock now while you can, man huh
'cause it's all about havin thangs
An' I'ma get mine fool!
Time for a change and change changes with time

Loud house and chains and swangin thangs (Hmm)

It was seven double oh P.M. Fly low to them hoes in the be
Sipping Seagram, chewing on a wheat stem
Touching on my four fin
Move it to the back so I can see who beeping this Po Pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shitted with three, one, two, seven, six, two, ten
Three line connection, as the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the weed, we got the drinks you need
And plus we strapped with two protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
'Cause I forgot where I met the hoe
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes want to snap
I straight up check the hoe, really doe, to the crib

Three miles per hour, like we running up on some rivals

Introduce myself, a to the motherfucking K finna recognize
Then I loose myself juice myself
As you take one pull, uh, pass it to the left and 'em
Self-centered niggaz'll take two pulls
'Cause they thinking about sampling 'em
P-I, M-P, ology, but logically
We're learning these hoes biology, and obviously, well

Mm, ain't this some shit, pull up in the see-A
D-I, Double-L, with ah A-see, A-see hoes
They peep those, P-I, M-P, and they think that automatically
'Cause he's a pimp, he gotta be, full of that
M-O, N-E, but why?
'Cause nigga be sporting nice cars and fancy clothes
Fresh jewels Girbaud flexing one five oh (chop chop)
Chop up that paper hoe, chop up that paper hoe
Watch where your lips go, caress my tip slow
To the tempo, instrumental
Real simple when you fucking with a pimp doe
Get involved in the backseat

Well a motherfucker might be broke and shit
And then collecting no dough from tips
But I be spitting mo' game than a mouthful of poker chips
To get them hoes with the Oprah lips and the provoking hips
And never gotta tell her many lies
I been looking in the city skies, get up in the kitty's thighs
'Cause I'm blessed with a look of innocence, good sex
Peanut butter complex and some pretty eyes
Pity cries on my strategy side, yo when out of me gotta be
Right, that'd be the flatter me right
But if the head the bonk come on suck a nigga dick
Members of my click, want to see what that'd be like
I know you want to try it out, to the rhythm of a high hat
Don't be bogus and deny that
I done got a hold of them my fellas on the train
While she lie back, now motherfucker can you bow down?
Where your ride at? On the passenger side of your hoes
Trying to come up on another G
The broad all up under me trying to smother me
Looking lovely while I roll another bead, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room she rubbing me with lotion
She cumming like an ocean coasting have a cigarette thinking
Me and Do or Die dig drinking love potion
The word that was never said
Twista be giving women dick in the bed
Until they sick in the head, and if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't tricking the Feds or spitting game
But it's chicken and bread
Kicking them legs in the air like a player do
Then be little in a day or two
After words I'm slay a crew, now that's some pimp type shit
That be Low and AK'll do, wearing gray and blue
If a hoe want to holler then you a player if you hit them ends
And get the dividends but you a pimp if you can get
The same hoe to want to freak your friends

Host your mind, like the color pink rubbin elbows with the wrong folks
Making kin bruise they skin, secretaries terminated after seeing her boss pack fudge
Dirty men need to do more than bathe, ha
How's about burned at the stake like the rest of them sodomites
Even though you had beautiful kids and a wife, he still went both ways
Ain't no due process for boys that become girls or vice versa

Shameless, what you've done

Shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

I'm smoking psychedelics, I hustle like a felon
Hottest record label, but still in all I'm chilling
Not a crack in my voice, this young nigga so poise
First I stack some money, then go to war with them boys
Anybody can get it, hand his man some tissues
Better ring the alarm, cause we bringing them pistols
Heaven singing them songs, speaking on sensitive issues
These emotional niggas, and most of them killas
They moving in silence, but they follow your Twitters
These the games that they play, they study your Instagram pictures
See I live by the code, that the mafia wrote
When he ran his mouth, me I ran the smoke
I'd rather listen, he had the?
I had to make a way, I had to act commission
Until this day am slanging, the commission remains
Now I'm worth over a billion, I'm ashamed to say

Shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

Oh, glidin' through the city to my place (my place)
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space (and you can still)
Oh, you can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back (Maybach Music)
Oh, ah, Maybach Music (Maybach Music)

Flows mind-blowing, these niggas switching the topic
All dick-riders, your label labeled erotic
You got a couple dollars, but really, it's barely modest
Couldn't sign me if you niggas was payin' homage
Playin' both sides, convicted you with verdict
Pay a lil' rider, come hit you up for the murder
Chains all hollow, I peeped soon as I heard it
These niggas be talkin' shooter, but quick to send they attorney
Is it really real, like Candy Lady allure?
Money overboard, kilos washin' ashore
Paintings on the wall, Versace down to the drawers
Currency come in Crypto, you know they tapin' our calls
Chariots and lofts, niggas legs crossed
Talkin' long money, but they conversation's short
New accolades with women for me to toss
They call it ""the road to riches"", regardless, I had to walk
Now it's too many cars, they say I live in a bubble
But I make it the point, we poppin' all through the Summer
Got pilots and gunners, receivers, passers and punters
My pockets playin' for keeps, G's get more than what's common
I made a few mistakes, I pray I get to repent
The passion came from the pain, I'm paintin' you all my sins
Warhol, Art Basel how it's so soft
More raw 'til Hov cut the 'fro off

Glidin' through the city to my place (my place)
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space (and you can still)
Oh, you can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back (Maybach Music)
Oh, ah, Maybach Music

Let's go for a ride to where your heart desire
I put your heart in drive, I'll let you borrow mine
My feet on top the clouds, I walk a thousand miles
She got them soft pussy lips, call it cotton mouth
And I'm on autopilot, got a larger closet
I'm at target practice, you at Target shoppin'
Second hand smoke got her vision partly cloudy
Her eyes get so watery, them bitches started drownin'
On the ride of a lifetime
Watch out for the rats, mice, cons and the pythons
No Triple H, my God, I'm so sky high
Comin' down from the night sky, like a lightening rod
Shine like some ice, nice vibes, like a kite flyin'
No strings attached, we replace it with a lifeline
Out of body feelin', out our clothes and our right minds
Baby, ride me like a bumpy road to the high rise, yeah, yeah

Glidin' through the city to my place (my place)
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space (and you can still)

918,"SixteenRick RossAndré 3000God Forgives, I Don't2012Hip-Hop/Rap",Rick Ross,"When 16 ain't enough...
It's funny because it's been on my mind lately
Having a dope beat, dope idea.
Sixteen bars ain't enough!
How the fuck can I squeeze my whole life into a 16 bar verse?
You know, so many different levels to living your life
Depicting with your wordplay exactly what life means to you
Sixteen ain't enough

I know y'all gonna feel me on this one
You gotta feel me on this one

It's funny how things change, funny how time fly
More than my feet travel, the more that I feel fly
More that I make now, the more that the chicks smile
She call me a local nigga, I opened a Swiss account
Eisenhower status, Etta James on the dash
Smooth as John Coltrane cruising in the Cadillac
Seville - feel my life on the real
We the Last Poets so this is a world premiere
Rolling like Mick Jagger, the women just getting badder
All I see is the money, cream, Eric Clapton
And all I wanted was one, 16 ain't enough
Talking that fast money, 15 every month
When your people labelled poor, that motivated me more
Everything I ever wore was once worn before
Roll with the punches now it's box office numbers
Dressed like Sammy Davis, steaming my marijuana
Double MG's, double M fees
We in every hood, nigga: government cheese
Yacht to Yachtmasters, Old Dirty Bastard
Floor seat for the Heat, paper that I'm stackin
Better put away a penny for the rainy days
Pick and roll, give and go, fuck a fade away
Living like Scottie Pippen, dribble riddles for vittles
Started off with a scribble, now I'm flowing a river
She say my heart cold, I'm naming my son December
Whitney died night before the Grammys -- damn, what a memory
Trump Tower and I started with a 10 speed
Born broke, had to use a nigga's instincts
Now I get a hundred racks for the 16
Waking up to turkey bacon and my thick queen
Niggas hating, I'm just watching on the big screen
3 stacks on the beat and the kicks mean
When 16 ain't enough...
You know how sometimes you got so much to say but
They on- they only give you 16, heh.
Man it's like. I mean, I got so much to say
The world has said so much to me, and I just wanna give right back to 'em
But... I only get 16, that's like a cage, you know
I really can't say what I wanna say, you know it's just a glimpse
That's all, just one uh, one little single glimpse
Just a page

But I guess I'm defeating the purpose of doing all this talking

Summer '88, or was it '89
Or was it winter-time, ah, nevermind
I'm in my room, booming
Drawin' LL Cool J album covers with Crayolas on construction paper
I'm trying to fuck my neighbor, I'm tryna hook my waves up
I'm tryna pull my grades up, to get them saddle lace ups
Before lil' Marc was Jacob, before them girls wore makeup
Before my voice would break up, before we'd tour them shake clubs
Before my mama wake up, before my crumbs would cake up
Before they tell me they love me and we'll never break up
Before the time she makes love to someone that I thought was my homeboy
But boy, was I wrong, now
I don't budge, don't want much, just a roof and a porch
And a Porsche, and a horse and unfortunately
But of course an assortment of torches that scorches the skin, when they enter
Intruders, whose tutors did a lousy job
How's he God if he lets Lucifer let loose on us?
That noose on us won't loosen up, but loose enough to juice us up
Make us think we do so much and do it big
Like they don't let us win, I can't pretend
But I do admit, it feel good when the hood pseudo-celebrate
Hence, why every time we dine we eat until our belly aches
Then go grab the finest wine and drink it
Like we know which grape and which region it came from
As if we can name 'em, hint hint, it ain't, um, Welch's
Hell just fell three thousand more degrees cooler
Ya'll can't measure my worth
But when you try, you'll need a ruler made by all the Greek gods
Because the odds have always been stacked against me when back's against the wall
I feel right at home, y'all sitting right at home
All Kelly green with envy while I'm jelly beans descending
Into the palm of a child, looks up at mama and smile
With such a devilish grin, like ""where the hell have you been""
She yelling that selling's a sin, well so is telling young men
That selling is a sin, if you don't offer new ways to win
A dolphin gon shake his fin, regardless if he gets in
Or out of water, most important thing for him is to swim
And Flipper didn't hold his nose, so why shall I hold my tongue?
(I miss the days of old when one could hold his gal on his arm)
And I set off these alarms, when camera's snap snap snap snap
Return fire, pa-pa-pa, pa, pa-pa, pa, pa, pa
They'll learn why, mere privacy, so essential
They won't make no laws, I break their laws til they see out our window
I take the fall to make them all treat human kind more gentle
Forsake them all, I hate them all, don't like em, don't pretend to
Yea something tells me we ain't in Kansas anymore
All that shit that used to be cool ain't cool anymore
All the women we were pursuing, now they want more
And they deserve it all, don't settle for what ain't yours

When 16 ain't enough...

When 16 ain't enough...

When 16 ain't enough...

When 16 ain't enough...

When 16 ain't enough...

Does your mama know you see me, does she know you're freaky?
Does she ever wonder if it's 'bout ya I am speaking?
Do you ever ponder where I'm at when you get sleepy?
How the hell I'm gonna tell the youth don't be me?
Yea

Does your daddy think you perfect, does he know for certain?
Does he know how you act when you pull back all them curtains?
Do he think I'm 2Pac cause I'm black and put the words in?
Does he know his daughter might have caught a real merman?

Cameras in the ceiling, Seline on my arm
We get ghost, you already know what it is
Money stuffed in my bag
Maybach shit

Bright lights and dark corners, it's night embark on us
Refugees running wild Wyclef with a Sig Sauer
Nothing to lose, I was starving from the start
Now the same cat drive in Jaguars
Open fire when you see me yell out and make em whisper
The club that I'm a member, they'll be gone by November
Keys to the city got killers who slither with me
Lamborghini, middle of the ghetto, smoke a fat fifty
Billionaire bid, wrists on chill
Standing in the field of dreams tryna see a hundred mil
These boys going blind they just happy being free
In a world of so many I just wanted me a key
Sheesh! I just wanted me a piece
Slice of cheesecake before my niggas all decease
These boys snort lines I'm fine just sipping wine
Amsterdam in the air, tomorrow on my mind

I'm Barry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo, so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Raw blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm living through these beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

Born in the bricks with the short end of the stick
Always running late, quick to show up with your bitch
The Hublot's cool but my Terminator's foolish
All stainless steel, quick to match it with my toolie
Red carpet event, the marijuana be lit
Red or blue, do you, as long as you're getting rich
Crack game, champagne, kilos on the stock exchange
Rolls Royce, new Ghost, that's a nigga pocket change
These niggas acting like they want a war!
When it come to whacking niggas I done won awards
Nigga, you a bitch, where yo' Honda Accord?
I'm riding in some shit only I can afford
Shouldn't claim the hood til you build a report
Amsterdam state of mind, I just gave you a tour
I'm laughing at the people who label me poor
Now I piss on Europeans, you'd think it was porn

I'm Barry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo, so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Raw blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm living through these beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

I'm speaking on unwritten laws the code of the streets
I'm not the type of nigga that you bump into
At a 7-11 and just pull your pistol on him
And do what the fuck you want to do
Niggas like me, you gotta get permission homie!
And that could take a long time!
In that time, I'mma handle my muthafuckin business

But just like Luda, I was born in the trap
Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
But like Soulja Boy, I was born in the trap
Broke ass niggas still begging for a stack
Take 'em to Shawty Lo, nigga, learn how to trap

Shit deeper than The Roots band
Fifteens drumming, questlove in the coupe fam
Riding through Pittsburgh, Wiz got the Steelers
Born by the jungle so I came with gorillas
Since niggas dropping more dimes than we fuckin'
We out the hood, tryna get money like Pete Touchin
Splitting backboards just to get our weed stuffed in
The crack we cookin, we don't need ovens
We need something to put in the mouth of our kids
Instead of copping chains, lets fly to Chile and dig
Go to Haiti and feed to the Bahamas and breathe
On the way back, to my nigga Sean from Belize, you know
Sometimes I feel like this rap shit is heaven sent
Then I get a high, feel like it's irrelevant
So I'm about to pop the trunk like an elephant
And campaign with Wyclef while he run for president
I'm 'bout to pop the trunk like an elephant
And campaign with Wyclef while he run for president
Told you I was gonna kill this shit, Primo

The diamonds in my emblems is cut like a princess
You can keep the Lexus, cause I got 2 Benz's
I'm in your girlfriends' hot intestines
Cause I bought her 2 dresses & some contact lenses
Got a message in a bottle, hit the throttle in my carro
Click & clack my semi auto cause I'm tryin' to see tomorrow
Bought a condo for my top hoe cause she workin' that taco
It's the top sellin' vato, 23's on the Tahoe
TV screens, margarita machines with street marines
Got love for the Crips & Bloods & Latin Kings
If it means anything this for all my G's
I'm in jail cause I forgot my fuckin' ABC's
Another DWI, drunk & fuckin' high
I'll be out before the muthafuckin' sun can touch the sky
They call me young Thurston Howell the 3rd
& That's my word
I'm a swang, I'm a swerve
I'm a park & scrape the curve.

Burn a few bridges, feed a few pigeons

No French kisses & no hippopotamuses
I'm picky, if you strictly dickly, you can't get with me
As I represent Houston like what? The damn Whitney
I'm a get 'em when I get 'em I loved 'em & I fed 'em
Lived in peace, I ain't gonna let 'em when I see 'em I'm gonna wet 'em
Shut 'em down like D-Town & my homey Ackavelie
Peace to Happareli & my nigga John Freddy
My drink is thick as jelly, I love my shit money
4 do's in this bitch & we gon' do them boys ugly
Ready for the rumble, leave 'em lyin' in a puddle

I'm just trying to do something right, so let me live my life
Even though I'm still hustling, I know you want to see me struggling
But at least I'm trying to do something right so let me live my life

Lord knows I had my share of doing the wrong things
But a bonified player that finds the life in me
Casualties make us cry but still we got to mash
Keep my eyes up on the sparrow and mind, up on my cash

Penetrate, finish last maintain a steady pace
Keep the busters out your business and haters up out your face
In this last rat race, the lord some's got to come
Shrivel my signature I call it rapping refunds

The ones that criticize be the ones you call your friends
The ones that ride it out ain't gone always be your kin
But then, you got to know, if it's yours you gone get it
But also you got to know that everyday, ain't terrific

Precision about your plans, keep it real with your fans
Watching my baby boy grow to be a young man
My daughter got to know, from the jump you a queen
And f*** what them n****s say you tell them your daddy is a king

Everytime I look around
These haters they be talking down
Big Moe that done bring more light
I even had a, had a harder time

But I'm still here still going strong
You can't believe what you hear in the song
About the year two triple o three
Whole wide world sipping drank with me

I got money but I'm still a little stressed
I thank the lord cause you know I'm the best
A little love set with the press
Why you want less cause through this

I guess it's best for me, to stay calm
And hold it down till the day that I'm gone
I got a white cup in my palm
Feel what a peach crush Mo-Yo's just a
Player, player, player, player

Money, the rule to all evil that's what I need
Between the hours of 3 to 7, that's when I bleed
Motherf***ers gone making the block hot, so I stay and move around
Tyte Eyez and Z-Ro stacking paper, it's going down

Break the shop of a n**** that's short stopping my change
But me and him to the fullest ducking bullets at close range
Feeling crazy, like I'm a lose my life to a b**** n****
But while I'm here I be a rich n****

Nephews and nieces, niece cool clothes and chains and pieces
I break bread with my family when my record releases
Besides skills in the west, n**** got mouths to feed
Anything against the grain just light a finger spot over seas

Saturday morning as a youngster I ain't have no bike
And I ain't have no Nikes, but in the triple I'ma have more ice
Around my neck and my wrist with fern doors

935,Told You So,T.I.,"Grand Hustle Pimp..
Hey, whats happenin shorty
Me being a true player and all
I mean you know as a stand up guy you know
I really hate to say I told you so
But, man I told you so
Back when we said we were goin to run this s*** man
When we said Pimp Squad Click, Grand Hustle was the business
When we said their was a whole nother side of Atlanta
A nother bunch of motherf***ers in the trap, y'all didnt know

Man, I told you so
They thought a pimp wasn't s'posed to blow
Because I was rappin about moving o's and blow
Pimp I told you so
They thought that Outkast closed the door
And Ludacris came in and sold his 4?
Man, I told you so
The Mac, C-Rod, Kuntry and Dro
And AK had the coldest flow
N****, I told you so
I said the future was right up under your nose
You thought the south wouldn't explode no more
Remember, I told you so

Way back when Kriss-Kross was hollering ""Jump"" on ya tube
They was still gettin jumped at school, we used to tote them tools
Don't get me wrong I'll give respect to them dudes
But approach us wrong, and we'll smoke them fools, ain't no joke it's the truth
F*** a hater, let 'em do what it do
I'm busy now, but I'll be through in a few
And then I'm coming for you
So keep s*** talking like it's something to do
I'll spend a 100 grand get a killer something to do
I been hustlin since 92' when I heard UGK
Hollering ""Pocket Full of Stones"" I was on my way
Had a history in the yay, before I started to trap
13, let me take you back farther than that
When my uncles was baggin blocks, used to count the stacks
I was only 8, and my grand-daddy can vouch for that
And my pops had alot of work, alot of folk he got 'em work
And ran numbers, said if he ain't wanna, he ain't gotta work
Why I sold rocks, I guess I got from pops
My uncles ? man ? a chip off the old block
The n**** you hear now the same one from off the old block
Who used to stand on Front St. and get off the old block

Man, I told you so
They thought a pimp wasn't s'posed to blow
Because I was rappin about moving o's and blow
Pimp I told you so
They thought that Outkast closed the door
And Ludacris came in and sold his 4?
Man, I told you so
The Mac, C-Rod, Kuntry and Dro
And AK had the coldest flow
N****, I told you so
I said the future was right up under your nose
You thought the south wouldn't explode no more
Remember, I told you so

I remember the P$C, Killer Mike, David Banner and me and YoungBloodz
Ran through Atlanta with heat, when even Atlanta was sleep
N****, back before you heard of me
I was middle man into serving keys when KC was serving 3
I'm on top because I deserved to be
So simmer down, calm your nerves at least
Speak your words with peace
Before you lay out on the curb deceased
Think about it, it's absurd to beef
I took my songs to street
He told me dopeboy was the bomb in the street
Since then, my name rang like alarms in the street
Who knew how long it would be
If only LA knew how wrong he could be
I told you ain't nobody stronger than me

Man, I told you so
They thought a pimp wasn't s'posed to blow
Because I was rappin about moving o's and blow
Pimp I told you so
They thought that Outkast closed the door
And Ludacris came in and sold his 4?
Man, I told you so
The Mac, C-Rod, Kuntry and Dro
And AK had the coldest flow
N****, I told you so
I said the future was right up under your nose
You thought the south wouldn't explode no more
Remember, I told you so

This southern rap s*** of the day is something I helped design
Puerto Rico of the mix show I'll let you know who the next in line
the Snowman, Paul Wall, the Thug ?
Alot of other n****z shouldn't of even been signed
Thats a opinion of mine
Because these n****z be neglecting the grind
Ain't waiting on nobody to let me shine, I'ma go get me mine
And then they wonder why they checks behind
Cuz TIP was 20k? back in the day, need me to press rewind
What be on these n****z mind, man don't get me to lyin
I seen ya kind, dopeboy, and that ain't even ya kind
Ain't never sold a gram of crack, and ain't no need of ya tryin
Back in the trap, pimp I don't see him survivin

Man, I told you so
They thought a pimp wasn't s'posed to blow
Because I was rappin about moving o's and blow
Pimp I told you so
They thought that Outkast closed the door
And Ludacris came in and sold his 4?

Only if you got beef, man, you better holla at me

I get high as I wanna, nigga
Go against me, for sure, you's a goner, nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves, but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me tell me you love me, don't stare at me, man
I'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans
Now let me show you how to greet me when you meet me, when you see me
If you real, my nigga, you know how to holla ""G-Unit""

If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne

And have hoes in the hood sniffin' on white lines?
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach 'em how to buck them .380's and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sippin' Guinness watching Menace
Then oh Lord, have a young nigga buckin' shit like he O-Dog
My team, they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave, nigga, go ahead get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot so ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money

944,Till I Collapse,Eminem,"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you got to search within you, and try to find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not Hip-Hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough

The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up?
For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck!

'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse

Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in

It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walking 'round like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me

'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out

'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd, how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse

My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

946,Cleanin’ Out My Closet,Eminem,"Where's my snare?
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo
Yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have
I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes
Look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me
But they never figure me out
Look at me now
I betcha probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama?
Imma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet

Ah
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby
Maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split
I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't owe him a second thought
I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie
And I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim
I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her, at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
But I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid
No doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have killed 'em
Shit, I woulda shot Kim and them both
It's my life
I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem Show

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position
Just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through hear purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what?
You're gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting' so big now
You should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her
She won't even be at your funeral
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song
Keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?
You selfish bitch
I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what?
I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet

Head to go good to go and I don't know your name
Is it the wheels on the hot car
Meals on the shock bar
Or you just want a quickie with a rap star
Ladies tell the truth you know I'm cute
But what really turns you on is the rims on my Coupe
Before you jump in my whip and you get dropped off
You goin' to the telly and you gettin' popped off
I can't stop thinkin' of the things you do
When your freakin' me and I'm freakin' you
I said the ice on my neck make the shorty's stare
Baby let me fly you in my lair
Stop slow down baby if you hear this in the club shake and go down baby
Its past my curfew but parole don't know
Tear up the club don't call my p.o.

Shorty so seductive dancin' on me

My ways be spinnin' I charm the amazing way
You know them black and white and asian women
Let's cut the small talk you know why I approach you
I can't stand when a dime act anti-social
Gucci, lip gloss, Louis Baton, and the boots from Batego Vanetto cost a arm
Yayo's a don my car European
You got mirrors in your pants 'cause I can see me in them
Listen I piss out Cris inhale haze
I'm in the Marriott gettin' laid all day
Tattoos and piercings and rings in your tongue
Shorty things like that will make my black dick cum
I need groupie love the Coupe on dubs
I'm in this club with a tre pound star
Don't blame it on David I'm all iced out
'cause 50 got me rich so the bar all priced out

Shorty so seductive dancin' on me
It's the way that she move that makin' me horny
If I wake up next to her in the morning

Burner at the side of your dome, come outta my throne

That this Gay-Z and Cockafella Records wanted beef

To explode it on a camel, and his soldiers, I can handle
This for dolo and it's manuscript, just sound stupid

Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly?

Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was getting chased through your building
Calling my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was gave you a style for you to run with
Smiling in my face, glad to break bread with the god
Wearing Jaz chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hanging with little Chase

Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause when she reaches for hugs, people hold their breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
Now, go
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian, Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They'll learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Princess when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying ""She's my Queen""

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

And it's lookin' for some meat it can get through
Fuck with me, there will be agony
In these streets, it will be a tragedy

If it was I would'a joined the Academy

Get back, y'all better get the fuck back
I never take shit from rappers
I turn them, motherfuckers into cadavers

Cause you'se a trick and your Ghost Rider is Casper

Cause you couldn't swallow deez nuts, big as a tractor
You dumb bitch, think I'm an actor
And a nigga couldn't get close enough to slap her

I introduce you to Ace Hood, Meek Mills
Big Sean, Wale, Vado, this the future
They gettin' money, they makin' hit records, they hustlin'

Okay now Khaled told me kill 'em, he just told me kill 'em
Hundred for the Beamer, Kudos for the dealer
Murder, bet I wrote it, Kudos to the killer
Chevy sittin' crooked, teeth on Reggie Miller
I'm a motherfuckin' beast, see me in your sleep
Nightmare on any street, swear I will mark any beat
Spread this to the industry, lyrics like a chopper piece
Flow right through your fitted T, pull this through with chemistry
Hottest nigga 'round, they saying greatness is my tendency
No such thing as sympathy, more money, my remedy
Pockets on, heavy D, bitch I'm hot, third degree
Whip I drive? Owned by me, wrists and neck, anti-freeze
Can it be? I'm who you dying to be'
Last of a dying breed, I'm Siamese
Twin pistol shooter nigga like a 7B
Big dog, get it, you still on your pedigree
Yeah, fly nigga with some stupid swag
Dead faces keep my money in the body bag
And the G-U-T-T-A, hops in the whip and I gotta get paid
Fuck them bitches, ain't trying to get laid
Walk in my house you can meet my maid
And you give a damn you can push that Lac
Push that Benz on, push that 'Lade, hop to the whip
No top on mine, hear a nigga hate, man fuck them guys
Real nigga shit, don't tell no lie
Private plane, my seat recline, top 10 charts, where I reside
Got me a house ?

We the muthafuckin best, word to my mama
Ridin' presidential, got me feeling like Obama
'Cause all I want is change
And my niggas they wanted the same
I wanted the money and never the fame
I turned into something they never became
Through all the rain, I kept my flame
And I kept burning and its my turn and
Real nigga my hood confirm it
Now it's 6 2's on closed curtains
And that Maybach, let me take em way back
When I was starving that was payback
Nigga where that cake at?
Murder all your artists
And I, I, I, I can feel that love,
But I feel that hate
When I got that ? I just feel so safe
I put it to your mug, you ain't gon' wake
When that thing gon' fly
Got a little kick, but it ain't no tired
Niggas talk murder, but they ain't gon ride
Now we goin' hard like I ain't gonna die
Meek Mill!

Do it! OK
Smoke until I got no lungs
Got her going down, no teeth
I call it ""speaking tongues""
Do it! Do it!
Now you speaking my language
From where they twist and talk with they fingers
Man but this ain't no sign language
Fresh out of the ashes
This a Detroit fucking classic from when MM got the masses
Trick Trick got them passes
Bitch I'm from the Motor, Motor
Yeah that motor be the fastest bitch,
They call it Motor City
'Cause you're most likely to crash (fuck it)
Good thing I got a chauffeur
Going broke? No sir!
Bitch I'm the rap game stylist,
'Cause I gave the rap game style bitch
But I over shine, ain't no niggas over Sean
Toll rollin by the quarter so I guess we're going overtime.
'Til we're Dumb high, dumb high
Westside, bitch I run mine
I'm rolling around in my old school, I feel like the alumni
Fucking hoes, no strings attached
So don't ask me why they strung out
I'm like Jordan to you niggas
I might even stick my tongue out
She wiggled and wobble, bobbled
Then landed on my throttle
Bitch, I might make you my baby
And even buy you a bottle
Yo niggas don't ask how the top feel?
When you keep em' right beside you
My pockets got paper on paper
This shit just look like a novel boy
100 thousand worth of ice on me now
But it don't feel half as good
As grandma saying she's proud

Forever dedicated, Maybach poetic genius
Some think they close to seeing me
Tell em they close to Stevie
You poser niggas ain't supposed to be here
We don't believe ya.
Double MG'er, we put a wreath on niggas' careers
We the best, Khaled
No need to stress, Khaled
Know there's a lot of artists
But I got the best palette
Multiple colors, my mind's more productive than others
Murray the winner, he think he really
Nelson Mandela

My balance be so tight rope
That's hard to find Quick Tri-Flow
Get rough With me, that Night flow
Hoes blow for me, I maestro, shit
That white whip sit
Like a slight wrist slit
Suicide shit, you can by shit if you write this shit
Nigga and right this minute, they say I'm buzzing hard
My driver's out of this world, you playing bumper cars.
You niggas under-cards
You should be unemployed
All you smoke is Reggie, I'm in the telly bunch of noise
Who gon' tell me that I ain't going or I ain't flowin'
Young Folarin, you see them puters
That was my influence

The towers fell, turning to Ground Zero
Kids didn't like Reggie Jackson
Nicki Barnes their hero
As I play Rothstein, Corleone like Rob De Niro
Been through it but here though
Don't move with the weirdos
Dress pimpin' the toast like let's win
Penthouses on West and 4th, pipes and Mac 6
While me in a Maserati bricking his best friends
When I die, tell them to turn my coffin to stretch Benz rims on it
Problems? My man's on, see him, we stomp him out
His mouth, our Timbs' on it
Always smoking a ounce, a mountain, no tens on it
Spins on it, you have no clout, the Benz on it

Few roaches, you need spray, on tours, eat straight
Making sure all your feet sprayed
Get the pills through, peel through SRT-8 truck on, seats gray
Drop tops like release dates, Vado",LyricFind

Looking over my shoulder, cause it's colder than it was
And start shorty, because I'm a little older than cuz
And the buzz from the saw, wit the chain to your brain
Will turn that big nigga to a fucking stain
The pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But I'm gon' die by it 'cause I'm like knee-deep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit
'Cause when you look in my face you see that hard shit
'Cause I done been to hell and back, I ain't rich selling crack

'Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did
Slid, cause I got to slide when the dirt is done
A homicide but they want me on the Murder 1
But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
Stay outta sight while it's light, and then come out at night
To make moves again, stomp and bruise again
I know I'm going to hell 'cause I choose to sin

Pussy ass niggas gotta watch out for the dikes
Seventeen five yeah nigga I said it
Seventeen five yeah nigga yeah I meant it
And when we do it bad and when we do it good
I'm so I'm so I'm so mother fucking hood

Everybody come equipped with bangas
Throwing up our middle fangas
And you know I don't slip so I gotta keep 10 in the clip and 1 the chambers
Better be walking with angels
And never take candy from strangers
Luda's dressed in stripes had to earn my stripes like I played with the Bengals
I'm in the zone homes going for the two point conversion
I'm so hood that Ludacris should have been on the original version
But this is the remix
With the cheap tricks
Hitting sweet licks
And I cut the braids off with the waves and the fade that will make you sea sick
See this is the way that we ball
And this is the way we roll
So put a fist in the air if you care
United we stand and divided we fall
When the south is in the house you better watch your mouth
Cause we on that hood shit I'm hood rich
Coming around your hood bitch
I swear I'm so.

I'm so hood (remix)
And if you feel me put your hands up
Hood
My hood niggas can you stand up
(I'm so hood)
And if you ain't from here you can walk it out

You ain't hood if you don't know what I'm talking about (Busta bust bitches)
I'm so hood

See all i know is that I got to get my money
Again and again
Top down
Let the money blow in the wind
With bad bitch sitting in the passenger seat
Where the doo be wrapped head full of bobby pins
You know I keep the thing when i walk
See the dialect
Different from the slang of my talk
Baby still living got a crack in front of another bad bitch that will
Boost for the spot
I'm used to leaving the strip last
Hustling until the sun comes up getting cash
So much bread in all of my coat pockets
It looks like a nigga got hips with an ass
And from the DNA in my blood
Niggas idolize me and
Try to do what I does
And if the other nigga ain't really from the hood
You can easily die
Tell who that fake nigga was (Hood)
And even though I split a little rap
Got Niggas in the hood trying to sell the most crack
Violator, i send a nigga to do it just to make you spend a lot of money just to get your shit
Back
You all niggas know where I'm from
And I rep it to the fullest until the day that I'm done
So hood where we live where my niggas sold drugs and they rich
And my niggas ride in the sun

Daddy fat sacks
So hood like the Cadillac
On the mint full of my balance
Call an ambulance
To come and pick his ass up because a nigga never had a chance
They try to dance with a devil in the pale moonlight
Advance on the level that they can't do right
Lay hands on a fellow like the man in blue lights
Woop, woop
Do it twice
You're boy the B - I - G
I'm nicer than MC in your top three
You cocky?
I cock, Squeeze
Bust them things not you sloppy
Speed it up, slow it down, then screw it
Don't bite the flow because I got that blew it
Run through the crew or some whole other new shit
Newness bitch we do this

I'm so hood (remix)
And if you feel me put your hands up
Hood
My hood niggas can you feel me I'm so hood
And if you ain't from here you can walk it out (up out)

Lilweezyana
Home sweet home depot
You will need a hammer
It go down like Frasier

Since I heard Plies I done brought the phantom back
Went and got me a 52 inch
Maybach
I'm eating like a big dog
I'm so full, I'm so good
I'm so straight, you so fake
I'm so real
I'm so hood

Yeah nigga
Welcome to the crack house
I should own a McDonald's
The way I bring the mac's out
I'm from the hood where every nigga lies
Flip a couple grand
They tell you the baking pies shit
Still got my name carved in that Central Booking
Gave that pussy a scar and told her good lookin'

I got an arsenal, a infantry, I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now, nigga, I'll be the end of you
Forget ya enemies and think of what'cha friends'll do

I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler & Koch'll tear half of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playin'
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture wit' words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall, nigga, watch me go for mine
I let 21 shots off at the same time, yeah

Cross the line, boy, I'ma air your ass out
Screw ya face at me, I wan' know what that's 'bout
Nigga, I know you ain't mad, I done came up
And if you are, fuck you 'cause I ain't change up
The O.G.'s wanna talk, but I don't know these niggas
And I ain't did no business wit' 'em, I don't owe these niggas
A minute of my time, I get it 'cause I grind
All across the globe like the world's mine, yeah

Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood

Oh, and when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga, but I will if I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around

Now tell me, have you ever looked up at an instance
And seen a MAC aimin' at'cha head, mayne?
Before you know what life is flashin' and reminiscin'
Your body is drippin' and full of lead, mayne
I done been there, I done cocked that
It ain't never been a question, I'm 'bout that
Don't go there, you can cock that
And if you plan to fuck around then reroute that

You'll never catch me ridin' around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons and loaded wit' dumb-d's
Stashed up under the carpet like a can of Seabreeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I'll be long gone like the Ripper

So don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block, I still will kill

California king, wrestle gators in the Everglades.
Drive up out that muthafuckin swamp in the Escalade.
So before you put that Red rag in your pocket.
I wanna see your fuckin resume.
Started off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate.
Rip rappers a new asshole: I never hesitate.
Dre beats on, smoking that chronic just to meditate.
I'm a give em hurricanes until another Levee break.
You niggas is featherweights, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight.
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate.
When a nigga whack, found me shit, I was selling weight.
Now a nigga's selling millions, now it's time to celebrate.
Performing in front of millions, nigga, every race.
6-4 in the '64, now watch the Chevy scrape.
4th album, no 5 mics? Then let em hate.
But I'm not stopping til I'm the king in every state.

Recognize my life, ridicule my fight.

Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights.
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write.
Familiar with cartwright, cause I wrote that shot, I'm a raging bull.
When the needle drops. For the record, I'm a wreck it, even if my record don't pop.
I'm a tie a knot on a Downtown building.
Let it toll behind me tell em they can find me.
In the dark with the ghetto children.
Look at my heart, nigga fuck your feelings.

This is me!
I'm sick of motherfuckers talking about ""the West died"".

Can't you hear my heart beating?
That's the motherfuckin West side, you test me, you test God.
I'm his son, it says in Psalms, you come at me.
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun.
You won't have time to run, I'm from the Compton slums.
And that's how the West ride.
I'm from the city where 2 of the best died.
Rest in peace to both of em, spit like I'm the ghost of em.
Damn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of em.
Name your top 10, I'm harder than the most of em.
Matter of fact, shorten your list nigga, top 5.
Game, Biggie, Hov, prolly Pac, Nas.
No particular order, bet a mil that I slaughter.
Serve niggas, give a fuck what you ordered.

How dare you niggas pop fly when I'm the nigga.
Sold 5 mil out the gate and numbers do not lie.

In the dark with the ghetto children.
Look at my heart, nigga fuck your feelings.
This is me!
I gave you the Documentary, shit was a classic.

Gave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package.
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average.
I was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope.
Spill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke.
And this is what you all been waiting for.
I'm the lost angel knocking on Satan's door.
What the fuck y'all take me for?
I love you cause you hate me more.
I'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84.
Shake you like Haiti's floor.
Walk up on you like ""what's going on baby boy? ""
Shots in that Mercedes door.

Either I'm crazy, or the black Slim Shady, or.
That be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more.
But I still owe Jimmy one more album.

You think you'll blow, on my door,
What the fuck, No,

So feel the need to bleed,

I wouldn't be the nigga that I am,
If I didn't pop niggas in they mouth,

And leave 'em covered in sheets,

Black unmarked cars, gotta peep how they playin'
Treat 'em like jack boys, catch 'em slippin' then slay 'em
Lord forgive me for my sins
That's my confession, if they put me in this Benz
I got possession of a federal offense
I'm talking pressure in my criminal intent (huh)
So wear ya vest's and I'm still gon' stunt
Like it ain't no tomorrow

And leave the D-Boys alone 'cause they motivate us
And why is the half of my whole hood on papers?
Some of 'em on house arrest, some of 'em on child support
Some of 'em done did they bid, the other half waiting to go to court
Mr. Landlord, we gon' bust your ass for that eviction note
Better have the police with you, dog, if you came to repo'

Bitch, I'm on probation, so my nerves bad
And they say time flies, well mine's first class
I landed in the sky, I fell from the streets
I talk a lot of shit and practice what I preach
Back from hell, cell twenty three
Tell the warden ""kiss my ass"", pockets on Monique
Bitch, I'm from the murder capital
Hoe, I'm far from practical
Shit happens and since I'm the shit, I'm who it happen to
Young Money, Cash Money, blood bitch, I'm red hot
I don't see nobody, see nobody like a head shot
All that bullshit is for the birds, throw some bread out

Everything's calculated and sound precise
Another move another mill', let's get right, aight?
Success is my drug of choice, I'm high off life
Feelin' lucky enough to bet it all on the dice

Hit the dance floor, move how you wanna move
Later on, we can cruise if you wanna cruise
It's whatever you want, the fact is, I got more than I flaunt (Yeah)

Bitches break their necks to be where I be
Take 'em to ecstacy without ecstacy

I'm the chef, you need a hit, I got the recipe
Doc got the antidote, it's in the drums and the notes
Can you feel it? Em said for me to make you feel it
And remind you that you rockin' with the realest

Get to poppin' and shakin' that thang on the floor
A little dose of it, now I want some more
Nobody put that thang on me like that before

I be a fiend for it, it's the way you move
But I ain't payin' for it, 'cause I ain't no fool
If you okay with it, tonight I'll stay with it
Hit the telly, play wit it, in a major way get it

972,Shot Down,DMX,"Over and over I done told ya, boy
I'm a G-Unit motherfucking soldier, boy
And when you gon' get it in your brain?
The gate's wide open and the dogs off the chain

I be that youngin with that gun that's tellin' ya stop frontin'
I be that youngin on the run after I pop somethin'
In the Bible I read death is of the tongue
And if you talk about death enough death is gon' come
Jay taught me how to flow, they shot him in the head
Randy ass was there, now he runnin' scared
Some say I'm gangsta, some say I'm crazy
If you axe me I'll say I'm what the hood made me
Now I can stunt till my ass dead broke like JD
Or put a hundred grand on every nigga head that play me
See I'm cool with them Haitian mob niggas
They say ""Sak pase Nap boule"" and rob niggas
The media be tryin' to make a nigga look bad, what's up with that?
See my flick next to Preme, Papi and Cat
And Montana, I kill 'em with the grammar
I enhanced in the slammer after bangin' them hammers
X, what up? (Aight)

You don't live that, you shouldn't say that
'Cause what come out your mouth'll get you shot down
Throwin' your money around and we don't play that

Put the faggots in the ring, watch 'em all quit
All y'all niggas is pussy, suck my dick
Ain't nothin' but a handful of man still standin'
I remember 50 in a cypher when Onyx was ""Slammin""
Now we meet again, it's all good, my nigga
Back to the street again, it's all hood, my nigga
Knock on wood, my nigga, we both walk the dog
We ain't get to where we at by luck, shit was hard
But once we got through the trials it's all smiles
Till a big type nigga all of a sudden get wild
Now why you gotsta go and take me back to where I came from?
I'ma make you remember where you know my name from
45th Street, and blaow-blaow Ave
I done ran through your crew and only let off half, nigga

You don't live that, you shouldn't say that

If your head ain't off of your shoulders
You ain't get shot, you got nicked nigga (Just nicked)
'Cause if my chrome hit a piece of your bone
It's gon' do more than chip, nigga (A lot more than that)
Yeah, what the fuck is the problem?
The Porsche is red, the buckets is army
30 shot handguns, the gutter is starvin'
Niggas like me might rush your apartment
Bloodstains'll fuck up your carpet, brain on the window
I smell murder every time that the wind blow
Tie him to the chair and then knock out his chinbone
I don't want the throne or the crown, I ain't sell enough
You can have the jail or the ground, you ain't in hell enough
I'm the one that flood the gutters
Better tap your man and let him know P'll love to cut his
And niggas is getting' shot down, two guns up

I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
And reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin

Strangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex
Drunk driving, trying to stack my loot

To take that chance and rob your man and beat up the pussy

Used to be hard now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le?
Lookin' like straight Bozos
I saw it comin' that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
When y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Livin' with the whites, one big house
And not another nigga in site
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now I'm makin' all the dough
White man just rulin'
The Niggas With Attitudes, who ya foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losin'
Ay yo Dre, stick to producin'
Callin' me Arnold, but you been-a-dick
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody helpin' me
Tryna sound like Amerikkka's Most
You could yell all day but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flowed
Ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B, and y'all disgrace the C-P-T
'Cause you're gettin' fucked out your green by a white boy
With no Vaseline

The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're gettin' fucked real quick
And Eazy's dick, is smellin' like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a hoe be a hoe, so
I couldn't stop you from gettin' ganked
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair and I'll cut them balls
'Cause I heard you like givin' up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Gettin' money out your ass, like a motherfuckin' Ready Teller
Givin' up the dollar bills
Now they got the Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's goin' out like Kunte Kinte
But I got a whip for ya Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yellin' Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren, 'cause I remember when you drove a be B210
Broke as a mothafuckin' joke
Let you on the scene to back up the First Team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they rippin' your asshole apart
By takin' your green, oh yeah
The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline

I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fuckin' your homeboys
You little maggot, Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E would be hangin' from a tree
With no Vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
'Til that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation, off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinkin' 'bout?
Get rid of that Devil real simple, put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew tellin' you what to do
Pullin' wools with your scams, now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk too
Tryna fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you

Now we're marking down our prices
And they're really, really hot

Get on some butterfly to the fire shit

I wanna sell you the dream
I wanna watch you come apart at the seams

Everything must go
You wanna get on some fly shit
Get on some butterfly to the fire shit

Heart of an altar boy molested in confession
Who plotted for 20 years then slit the throat of a reverend
And half of this thought is young vandal the system
Contraption of credo drift, sick shit and spit at your heaven

I'm grabbin' my dick again, foot on the wall, pose down
I'm drinkin' that piss again, back at the train hometown
Starscream the system, ninja star the cassette deck
Lazerface is back in effect

Focus like a worker ant live, get with hive mind fly shit
Shut your little mind crime hybrid
Eyelids pinned back flat, we had a focus group
Of lab rats clappin', at last you got dap

Automaton bells rock well from death valley
Shit, we all mingle in ditch, mass grave for the kids
Clash with the combat rap set
A weathermen funk breath, the last rebels left?

Slide off or get the digipack slashed in your neck
You're fidgetin' with 28 day simian
Yeah, dog him again, the bad touch destruct militant
Drum percussion lust diligent

The surface that gave birth to the style is NY
The jihad recipient sky is too fly
The roof of the witnessin' spot was BK

A cloud of asbestos, I guess it's D-day

Now you want me to move and do how you say
Or look into my brain through this glass toupee
Fuck this, how 'bout I just smack you bitch?
Save that 4th Reich boogie for them plastic twits

Or the old women of fate stichin' the casket nits
I'll be drunk on the back of the train takin' a piss
Bumpin' BDP through a Raheem kit
With a double d Duracel destiny megamix like

This kid asked me who the fuck I thought I was, I was like
This

Big wins is all it takes

Excuse me, little child, why the devious smile?
Well, I've become what I've forsaken and the irony's wild
Are you in charge of this outfit? Nah, not me, cousin
I wrestle distinction from the chompers of a buzzard

Is my mommy in Heaven? Well, she's definitely not here
Now run away and go play with this hatchet and flaming spear
I'm tryna mix up this Molotov, then peel the fuck off
I've got a windmill to tackle, son, polish my gun off

My hot pink millimeter space heater, duck down
Pulled out from the crevice of a triple fat, duck down
Horse hooves and meat I'm glued to the beat grindin'
Stolen hovercraft draggin' a bass stab behind it

Every little phrase is designed for y'all to rewind it
Every brittle phase has an expiration assignment
Eyes wide, the bad man walks alive
With five dimes of sticky, the bush and no 9

Who was trained by Ed Koch to hop a turnstyle
See cop smile, peep cops gun
Now see little juvenile me in Reeboks run
Through the projected transformation of the catacombs, son
Makin' it home's so fun

If you're alone, don't sweat 'cause you're alone with the best
The underrated phrase mason who's leakin' pain to cassette
If you hate lies, don't fret 'cause I can't lie about this
At least I'm honest when I tell you that my mind's full of shit

And sick of skippin' on electrified hop scotch grid
We're double dutchin' to percussion
With this barbed wire rope choker
The most floatinist spoke dope spit, get lit
You're with an ambulance chaser, I strive design sick

994,Hood Took Me Under,Compton's Most Wanted,"I got another gang story to tell.
Peep, about how a black nigga was born in hell.
And right then and there it's no hope
cause a nigga can't escape the gangs and the dope.
Damn! And when its black on black, that makes it shitty.
Can't survive in the Compton city.
And fool that's bet.
Cause when you grow up in the hood, you gots ta claim a set.
Geah, Its not that you want to but you have to.
Don't be a mark, cause niggas might laugh you
straight off the mutherfuckin block.
Can't deal with bustas so they asses get clocked.
geah, who gives a fuck about another.
Only got love for my fuckin gang brothers.
Geah but I'm young so nobody would wonder
That the hood would take me under.

[scratching: always strapped and eager to peel a cap
The hood done took me under.]

Now I'm a few ages older
got hair on my nuts and I'm a little bit bolder.
And puttin in work, I has to do my fuckin part,
I'm down for the hood and its planted in the heart.
Fool. At school slappin on the girls asses
Fuck the white education so I skip a lot of classes.
Cause ain't no teaching a nigga white reality.
Teach me the mutherfuckin gang mentality.
Pop pop pop, drops the sucker
if he's from another hood I gots ta shoot the mutherfucker.
Geah I'm in it to win it and can't quit.
Fool, and ready die for this shit.
One times can't fade the gang tuff.
Puttin my foot in your ass to make times rough.
I'm the neighbourhood terror but I never wondered
that the hood would take me under.

+[police is hot, so I'm watching my back...]

I guess I'll watch my back cause niggas jivin'
Times heard this brother pulled a 187.
Who I thought was my homie dropped the dime.
So I gotta peel his cap with the nine.
Fool, so if its on then its on, fuck ya G,
because how the odds are looking, its either him or me.
So I loads up the strap and I step
cause my brain cells are dead and all I think is death.
Revenge. That's what its all about.
See the sucker, take the mutherfucker out.
Stare the fool down with the eye contact.
He try to swing so I draw on him with the gatt.
Blast was the sound that one times heard uh
Nigga 25 to live for the murder.
Was it worth it I've always wondered.
Maybe if the hood didn't take me under.

Geah, this going out to all the niggas,
It's going out to my niggas.
Its going out to all the niggas,

995,Murder Rap,Above the Law,"Yo, Cold 187
They tryin to give you a murder rap
And you ain't even like that
Yo, serve these niggas, cause they deserve to get dissed
(Yeah)
(Check this out)

When I sit down and write and recite for the mic I hold
Make sure my beats are loud, and bold, and Cold
187, that is my name, makin' it simple and plain
Here to rearrange and change
The things that I didn't do in the past
Don't be surprised when you got a shotgun up your ass
Perpetrators, that one was just for you
I'm gonna leave ya in your seat remaining without a clue
Glued to my style like a fiend on coke
But if you say the wrong thing, I wash your mouth out with soap
Dope is not the answer
No, I'm not a Cancer
No, I'm not a hero or zero
But a Leo in stereo
And this is not a demo
K-oss and Go Mack be cuttin the flex tempo
Fast

Yo, fingerprints ain't nothin without the murder weapon
Keep steppin
Homicide tried to sweat, but we let em have it
You can see they fear through they tears
Treat em like Robanes and give em some relief

I feel action speaks louder than words and verbs
And adjectives, I live the life, the given gift
Not who's first, second or third
Not he said or she said, or what you heard, nerd
Cause when you live like that, your life is mangled
In other words your life is all tangled
Up, I'm not a sucker, always go for mine
Powerlord that's hard from the start, and we will always (climb)
To the top as I seek and achieve
Sometimes that's even higher than the others believe
I'm not a doctor on a board, I don't have a degree
Not arrogant, egotistical, I'm the epitomy
Re-take, recline, keep suckers in line
Transform into another world as I recite these rhymes
187, he's as hard as it comes
And I don't have to brag about the size of my gun, son

Criminals don't use lyrics and define themselves as notorious
Brothers gotta learn hip-hop anger rages inside themselves
Your freedom will never resist my contact K-Oss and the homie G

187 breakin back, backbone of my group
Fat kid in my posse, and I'm gettin loose
Cause I'm takin out posses, causin bodily harm
Makin moves to improve as I begin to brainstorm
I'm not inferior, not takin' no crap
Last sucker tried to dis me, cold got his neck slapped
Cause Power's my name, sometimes I'm insane
And if I get too mad, I have to rearrange
The posistion as a MC, that's the way it should be
The way I get over, I use terminology
That's comprehensive, redemptive
That's evidently not related to the style that you hear everyday
B-boy destroyin a toy, employin
While the other suckers are depressed, I'm enjoyin
What I'm doin, and ruin any insult of my position
Tell em KM.G - they on a mission

They on a mission
They keep wishin you can't come off
187, you're a menace in your own mind
So take heed and proceed with caution

Everywhere I go, I gotta tag along

And wait for me on the bench when I run a game of basketball
One squeeze'll make a bastard fall, gasp and crawl
You need a bulletproof vest, mask and all
Bring your buddy when it's time to roam (why?)
'Cause I got hit the last time I left mine at home

My hand bling full of platinum to shine his chrome
He even got closet space inside my home
He ain't never been broke, he glitchless
He's so reliable, I bought him a rubber coat for Christmas
Infrared beam and a scope for distance
The best company when approaching business

Last time he did the cops had the block all locked off
Take him with me to hustle, stashed him in a trashcan
My fingertips soft, for four hours I bag grams
You meet him, your destination's hell or heaven
'Cause I only bring him out for that 187
He don't have a heart, I just keep feeding him shells
He get it popping in the hood, so his name rings bells

Ms. Jones stay on the third floor, she called the cops on me
They came, I ran, I had to toss my other little homie

I stay screaming on niggas and beating up base heads
These niggas ain't thorough, they just like to pretend
Keep fucking 'round, they gon' say hello to my little friend

We been through it all but yet we both still living
We been in a box but we both still spitting
And when there was beef, you even played your position
Got under the seat until we spotted our victim
At first they wouldn't listen 'til they heard you go off
Remember it was broad daylight in the middle of New York
And little did they know that we was ready for war
Bet the nigga wish he never stuck his head out the door

See whenever you come out, something happen on the block
You the reason that nigga done stopped rapping like Pac
People see you and run, and you ain't even say shit
They just know you ain't nothing to play with
You stay with 16 homies, and one in the hole
When the first one get out, the next one go
To know where you headed, you gotta know where you been
The Glock stay with me, we friends 'til the end

Times is changing, young niggas is aging
Becoming O.Gs in the game and changing
To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rapping
When niggas get wrapped up in image and acting
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags: when it happens, that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em blow
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money: I lost them both
Went visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe

Niggas aim mainly at niggas they can't be
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
I'm out of sight, now I'm out of they dang reach
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug, how much 2Pac in you you got?
I ain't no bitch, neither
It's either my life or your life
And I ain't leaving, I like breathing
Nigga, we can go round for round
Clip for clip, shit, fo'-pound for pound

Keep us trapped in the same place we're raised in
Then they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges
Cause every time you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters living amongst us
Lookin' at us, now calling us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us
Nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
And this the motherfucking thanks I get?

But thirst for worse beats
So I can put more product out on the street
Get respect and love all across the board
We've been adored for keepin' it raw
Nothin' less or more, I score every time for sure
While the rest of y'all niggas just nil

Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD, 'cause it's never enough

1001,How Many Mics,Fugees,"Pick up your microphones ha ha
Pick up your microphones

How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Say me say Many moni, Say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Say me say Many moni, Say me say many, many, many

I get mad frustrated when I rhyme
Thinking of all them kids who try to do this
For all the wrong reasons
Seasons change, mad things rearrange
But it all stays the same like the love doctor Strange
I'm tame like the rapper
Get red like a snapper when they do that
Got your whole block saying ""true dat""
If only they knew that
It was you who was irregular
Sold your soul for some secular
Muzak that's wack
Plus you use that loop over and over
Claiming that you got a new style
Your attempts are futile, ooh child
Your puerile
Brain waves are sterile
You can't create, you just wait to take, my tape's
Laced with malice
Hands get calloused
From grippin' microphones from here to Dallas
Go ask Alice if you don't believe me
I get Inner Visions like Stevie
See me, ascend from the chalice like the weed be
Indeed be like Khalil Muhammad
MC's make me vomit
I get controversial
Freak your style with no rehearsal
Oh, contraire mon frere
don't you even go there
Me without a mic is like a beat without a snare
I dare to tear into your ego
We go, way back like some ganja and pelequo
Or Coleco, Vision
My mind makes incisions in your anatomy
And I'll back this with Deuteronomy
Or Leviticus, God made this word
You can't get with this
Sweet like licorice
Dangerous like syphillis, yeah

How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do you rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many

I used to be underrated
Now I take iron, makes my shit constipated
I'm more concentrated
So on my day off
With David Sonnenberg I play golf
Run through Crown Heights screaming out Mazel Tov
Problem with no man
Before black, I'm first human
Appetite to write like Frederick douglass with a slave hand
Street pressure word to poppa, I ain't goin' under
One day I'll have a label and make deals with Tommy Motolla
Momma always told me ""you're one in a million""
Always watch your back, never tangle with Haitian Sicilians
Now I got a record deal ""how does it feel?""
I'm never gonna survive unless I get crazy like Seal
Cause the whole world's out of order
So at night the fiend's dance on Grease with John Travolta
One got slaughtered as he coughed blood from his mouth
The other tried to duck and caught a left with my Guinness Stout
Brother brother can't you get this through your head
It's a set up by the fed's they're scoping us with their Infra - reds

How many mic's do you rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do I rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many

Too many MC's not enough Mic's
Exit your show like I exit the turnpike
Dice and dynamite like dolomite
double deuce delight, I don't Dick Van Dyke
Startlight to starbrite the freaks come out at night
Like my man Wyclef (I wear my sunglasses at night)
And my panache will mosh your entourage
Squash your squad and hide your body under my garage
And when the cops come lookin'
I'll be bookin' to Brooklyn
Leave the trails broken flippin' tokens to Hoboken
A clean getaway like Alec Baldwin
Drivin' in my fast car playin' Tracy Chapman

How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do you rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many

Methods, I'm not the king
But niggas is decaf, I stick 'em for the cream
Check it, just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad, fish accept it

In your Cross Colour clothes, you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Krossed
Who the boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force

Check it, 'cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof

Huh, vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me, ayy, give it to me raw
I've learned that when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a ho
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay the roll

I`m dead up serious so don`t be getting too curious
Motherfuckers always want to know what makes me tick
I`ll pull a phrase out quick 'cause I`m dipped and I`m slick
You thought that I would slip 'cause you seen me drinking forty`s
It shocked you then you told your friends you saw me
Well say what you want 'cause all of mine is in tact
In fact I`ll have you open like a hookers gap
I like to catch a buzz 'cause I get into the beats more
MC`s are washed up like dead fish on the seashore
Save the talk 'cause you know I walk that walk
Hitting city to city but I make my home in New York
I know the time with this rap shit 'cause they got it all backwards
They need to take a hint or catch my microphone imprint
Straight to the dome through the skull to the tissue
Call me Guru I`ll diss you if you`re pressing the issue
Not my style to be sweatin` all the stupid ass rumors
I take it as a compliment and fuck you too
If you`re scheming on the chance to put a stain on my name
Don`t even think about it 'cause ain`t no shame in my game

No shame in my game
Stick to the subject I ain`t afraid to be real
A lot of MC`s fake hard just to gain appeal
I like some gangster rap, don`t like the prankster crap
So I get passed all that by kicking straight up facts
There ain`t no reason to shoot unless you got beef
If you pull out and you don`t use it than you may catch grief
Toolies and techs ain`t toys but kids got `em today
And if they`re ready to spray best get the fuck out the way
I try keeping my sanity by thinking of better times
If I write clever rhymes then maybe I`ll climb
But what the hell`s success if the mess ain`t changing
50`s still corrupt stupid gangs still bangin`
Stick up kids still stickin` nasty hookers still trickin`
All the pimps still pimpin` and all the crackheads trippin`
While the dealers still sellin` so I`ll refrain from the yellin`
And the preachin` 'cause who the fuck would I reach man
Niggaz don`t want to stop that, they want to live fat
Who`d want to clean up their act when the papes come in stacks
They live for the minute and they`re all wrapped up in it
It`s an unfortunate state for many it`s too late
Now death stalks the streets and it`s right at your gate
So bug, lose your mind but I ain`t goin` insane
I`ll kick the fly lyrics 'cause ain`t no shame in my game

No shame in my game
Life`s a bitch so who are we to judge each other
I know I got faults I ain`t the only motherfucker
Stuff I heard about you wasn`t too cool you know
Like how you smoke wools and that your girl`s a ho
But I don`t listen to shit unless the story`s legit
Knuckleheads need to quit 'cause they be riding the dilsnick
But I`ll be taking care of business regardless
And when it comes to rhyming you know I`m hitting hardest
So you can kick dirt but in the end you`ll feel pain
You little sucker, there ain`t no shame in my game",LyricFind

Then grew to a physical body with five meridians

Two thousand, wickedness is spread amongst my citizen
I got a muscle the industrial to make a hustle
And politic with Lyor and Russell

Thoughts are contained in the trenches of the brain
Ignite, blowin' the mic to Arabian heights

Deadly ground I hold down
Classical gangland style, shots hit the ceiling
Panic and confusion echoes through the building
Continuing to build, I strive for perfection
Driven by the will to live, Glocks I hold
Shots I give, while searchers of rescue teams
Look for means of survival and who's liable
For this harrowing experience

And proceeds of the Wu-Tang Academy
To fuck up your anatomy with assault and battery

1012,The Message,Nas,"Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jumped out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Ze make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes, thirty-two shotguns
Regulate with my dunn's, 17 rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of living, Vegas style roll dice in linen
Antera spinning on milleniums, twenty G bets I'm winning them
Threats I'm sending them, Lex with TV sets the minimum
Ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny
Wet any clique, with the semi TEC who want it?
Diamonds I flaunt it, chicken-heads flock I lace 'em
Fried broiled with basil, taste 'em, crack the legs
Way out of formation, it's horizontal how I have 'em
Fucking me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC it won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit, as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs, bug 'cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

I peeped you frontin', I was in the Jeep
Sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' 'bout how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked a baby 9 that nigga grave be mine, clanked him
What was he thinking on my corner when it's pay me time?
Dug 'em, you owe me cousin, something told me plug him
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came asking me my name, what the fuck
I got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watching all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun, and yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The 'Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' L's sippin' Coors, on all floors of project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together, Uptown copping the raw
But uh, a thug changes, and love changes
And best friends become strangers, word up

Thug niggas, yo, to them thug niggas
Gettin' it on in the world, you know?
To them niggas that's locked down
Doin' they thing, survivin', ya know'm sayin'?
To my thorough niggas, New York and worldwide
Yo, to the Queensbridge Militia, yo
'96 shit, The Firm clique
Illmatic, nigga, It Was Written though
It's been a long time comin'
Y'all fake niggas, tryna copy
Better come with the real though

1013,Won’t Trade,Q-Tip,"For your epitaph, niggas laugh, chicks steady gas your ass
Siphoning out your cash, seein' the door, the flash
While I stay enclosed, walkin' out in my clothes
She said, ""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

You motherfuckin' right, wantin' this shit every night
Finish up, I hold her tight, wearin' feelings on my sleeve
Even when I had to leave, cooler than the evening breeze
Do you believe?
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

The Division One leader, in the rebound with numerous shorties, off the post
Goin' coast to coast, she on the hardwood, sub, I'm out the game
She sayin', ""Nah, he good"", I mean
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

For no amount of dough, franchise this man
Give him all the things you can
Think long-term plans, he be bringin' in the fans
Front-page magazine, listen to this lady scream:
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

Cause she know what's better for her
Toppin' in the peckin' order
Fluid like the runnin' water, nicest nigga? Kinda, sorta
When he screamin' just the slaughter, no matter the quarter
I get it
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

The club-house king, battin' practice, slug and swing
Game time's anything, when I'm in, you're 'bout a minute
Holdin' the bat, it's good as fact
She's out the park, and comin' back
She sayin'
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

Everywhere you sit you get a good view of the ballplayer and all
And the famous hall inevitably will make a call
Hangin' memorabilia from your walls
This is why you can't trade me
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

You can put your money on a sure thing
Certain profits will they bring
Ceremonies are the ringer, in the White House thing
Clear your mantle, the trophies I bring
Do you wanna trade?
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

Cause in the end as a teammate
You're lookin' for a back shoot, and go-to ball
Leaves it all on the floor, always lookin' to score
Pep-talks in the locker-room
This is why you sing this tune
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

And injuries can't make me sit, I ball till you get out
Hook off, no di-doubt, and all like get out
I train for the pressure and come out fresher
Equipped for the game, you know my name
It makes me better
A cheer, for the whole team, let's go, for the whole thing
The ballad that you're holding, MVP voting
And I, represent the sentiment, you're emoting
As you say
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

The physical ability, with mental capability
Legitimately places me inside of your vicinity
And I ain't really seein' me vacatin' this community
I'm stayin' here
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

I'm glad that you feel this way
Here's where I like to play
I need to hear it everyday, they cheer for me, say, ""Ole""
Wait a minute, ""Andele""?
I dunno, well, anyway

And watch a flick, illin and root for the villian, huh
Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After being blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexing
Cheap lubrication, Lifestyle protection
Picking up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rockin the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well acapella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella fella
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops

Niggaz catching 3 to 9's, Muslims yelling free the mind
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid when I would say that out of town, niggaz chased us

I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a meance, yo, police wanna murder me

My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights then inhale, it stimulates

Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot
And expand alot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make ya heads bop Pah
I shine a light on perpetrators like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I raided
I hold a Mac-11, and attack the Reverand
I contact 11 L's and max in heaven

claiming they live but if you pop em they snitching
some wise from the building, the game knowledge of dealers
knowing they lack the heart of those who out on the benches
I was out in the trenches
which enables me to paint such a powerful picture
like Apocalypse Now
I put my heart in my lyrics, every time I sit down
I write, my source of inspiration ain't 3 and a half mics
I must have been an mc in my past life
presently I'm unquestionably poetic, I'm that nice
people act like, I don't deserve nothing I got
I grew up in the spot
my sleep was interrupted by customers knocks
some of y'all should just stop the animosity you got for me
luck it was not
for years we ran the projects like a marathon
these catastrophic, my time depth of pride became my own conquest
subsequently some are with me others ain't yet, the gun is within me
I wish for nothing except that my mother was with me
some place judgment against me based on nothing but envy
they pray for my downfall like the song by biggie
born in the city which never sleeps till rest in peace
its carved in stone some starved while others bled to eat
rap is my legacy I leave my seed my destiny
except I hope she never see the treachery success will bring
the trife life and death of kings
I'm from the rarest breed of people who rep the street and spit poetically
never sleep, rest assured mega is dope in its pure form
the dealer mc, keeping it real is my protocol
fall back I got you hoping off the style- I was working on it
the beat is lifeless, till I put my verses on it
I reminiscence confinement as I read a kite from
my people with secret inditements
freedom and trying, contemplating putting streets on the tires
dominating this beef with my rhyming as if you need a reminder
I spit that drug dealer shit you might have seen on the wire
what other lyricist is known for giving people consignment?
I'm eager to find my equal at rhyming
I rock, iceberg jeans with the nikes
an extremist when rhyming deep as poseidon
we lived in violence now I live in a peaceful environment
a secret asylum from the streets where people be wiling
some blind with fury from seeing my shining

Deadly venomous elixir
Hammer like Sledge that be Sister

All and together now, follow me, the Mista
Meth Candyman, farewell to the flesh
Death come, in the scripture, two-thousand one
Bring the rap arma-gedde-on, let it be known

With all that wack shit, now you know
You dead wrong, one thousand lashes

The kids rank, snatch collars off, while ridin' off
Float boat big boys, Oakland A's stashed away blades
Ventilation let the sharks, ani-maze

Seekin', where you went wrong
And why would I bring you such physical harm?

Guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
Sniper in the cypher, I, Pied Piper
Move the housing by the thousand, I watched out the Chrysler
Bombs strike ya like the mighty Thor, blast the door
Recite a page like a tidal wave, past the shore

Pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a hairful
Heavenly laced, stimulation make you feel slow paced
I motivate and await my sober state

Magnificent, heavenly the God stay bent
Five Percent Range whippin' soul controller of the lynch
Mackin phone rings, Stephen King trauma down at Danzine
My mood swings, suplexed off the rope, magazine
Coconut jewels, wore no color shoe, knife annual
Moses lost his sandal, hidin the manual

Seize posin in Oshkosh, guzzle cries
Sabotage massage rap bandit at large

They kill one man, or kill ten

After all, they can only hang you once

Picked up the broom thought I was Michael-in'
West Brighton Pool, now I'm into Iron Duels
Turn nuns to Earths, Whoopi, she at Allah school

Inhale break beats of Hell a-alikes propel parallel
Duracell knot, you flashed a burnt cell
Snap out of Candyland, kids, the old rumor is
Blacks become immune and shit, we never did
Like eating dead birds, trust the pharmacy over herbs
Men marrying men, ill they got the urge, pulsar
Scissor hand wig vanished in the winter, living off land
You goddamn right, I fuck fans, king me
Check, checkmate, props like the micro chip founder
Neck to neck stock with Bill Gates now

Priceless ropes, lay around the God, get tangled
Woolly hair, eyes fiery red, feet made of brass

Move, every script's like Miramax
Smashed the big boy, totaled it, Wilshire and Fairfax
Sun beamin', wifey on the beach sipping Zima
Wu 'binos to Latinos, we love Selena

Pretty silhouette, velvet nice, DNA scroll genetics
Too hot to handle, one thought from scrambling the mandolin
Hundred game Wilt Chamberlain, smack 'em, say when

He rollin' up, face wrinkled up, hands is on his nuts
Yo kid, stop fronting on the grounds 'fore you get touched

He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fatter joints called undergrounds
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man, boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly 'cause hip-hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked the light blue-suede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip-hop era?
Was fresh in fact since they started sayin' outie
'Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie

I melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated

'Cause I grabbed the mic and try to say, ""Yes y'all!""
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small
Cool, 'Cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet

Back to the lab ...without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the other one, then I make another one
To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done

I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and

Thought of, Cuz it's sort of... an addiction
Magnatized by the mixing
Vocals, vocabulary, your verses, you're stuck in
The mic is a drano, volcanoes erupting.

Rhymes overflowing, gradually growing
Everything is written in the cold, so it can coin-
Cide, my thoughts to guide,
48 tracks to slide
The invincible, microphone fiend Rakim
Spread the word, 'cause I'm in

E-F-F-E-C-T

A smooth operator operating correctly,
But back to the problem, I gotta habit,
You can't solve it, silly rabbit
The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
I fiend for a microphone like heroin

Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix
Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
Unawareness? Beware, it's the re-animator!

A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
An assassinater, if the people ain't stepping
You see a part of me that you never seen
When I'm fiending for a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend...

After 12, I'm worse that a Gremlin
Feed me Hip-hop and I start trembling
The thrill of suspense is intense, your horrified
But this ain't the cinemas of ""Tales From the Darkside""

By any means neccesary, this is what has to be done
Make way 'cause here I come...
My DJ cuts material...
Grand imperial.

It's a must that I bust any mic you're hand to me
It's inherited, it's runs in the family
I wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's back
If that don't slow 'em up, I carry a full pack.

Now I don't want to have to let off, you should of kept off
You didn't keep the stage warm -- step off!
Ladies and Gentleman, you're about to see
A pastime hobby about to be

Take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm
Hype as a hyperchrondriac 'cause the rap be one
Hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke
More than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke

More than cracked up, you should have backed up
For those who act up need to be more than smacked up
Any entertainer, I got a torture chamber
One on one and I'm the remainder!

So close your eyes and hold your breath,
And I'm a hit'cha wit the blow of death
Before you go, you'll remember you seen
The fiend of a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend

1024,Sing for the Moment,Eminem,"These ideas are, nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about, his f- dad walking out
'Cause he hates him so bad that he, blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talking back
Talking black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, doo-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changing, intertwining with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a mothafucka, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the f- did this metamorphosis happen?
From standing on corners and porches just rapping
To having a fortune, no more kissing ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listening to me religiously
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fucking menace this shit doesn't make sense B
It's all political, if my music is literal
Then I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too Guerrera; that was a fist that hit you

Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (sing this shit!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear 'bout us toting pistols
And they wanna get one 'cause, they think the shit's cool
Not knowing we really just protecting ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fucking thing that we wanted
That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night wishing they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothing to you, but we're the fucking shit in their eyes
That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of four million and a half feet
That's eight million miles in the sky
Please undo your seat belt for take off
You are now free to smoke about the cabin

I'm Dre, from back in the day
From N.W.A, from black and the grey
From chokin' a bitch to smacking her face
From stackin' up bodies to racking AKs up
From racking up hits to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happenin' in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, far as competition, faggot, there ain't none

Speak of the devil, it's the attack of the Rain Man
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun, vrun, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon? No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny, man, it's urgent, I need one
Two boxes of detergent in a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1

So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you are now smoking with the best, best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you are now smoking with the best, best)

Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless
A nice environment, surprised entirely
Hypnotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen; say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy, I could spin
Vin-vin, fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple, I pinch both, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse; if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake in the morning next to the porcelain

So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you are now smoking with the best, best)

Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way

Where there's fire, there's flames
Where there's flames, there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

Nah-uh, he ain't playing
He's gon' get the AK and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane, Vodka and creatine
Hpnotiq and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's giving me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on the girl, you won't catch me CSI
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make them tremble and shake

Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you smokin' with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rollin' shit up
You muthafuckers ain't smokin', you just holdin' shit up
Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that makes the records go number one
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
Won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing as how I blew up off puffing them trees

Well smoke enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up, Cheech
Come on, smoke me up cuz, get me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff

I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress
That's been eating me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me
I don't know you, and no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me

My tank is on empty, no patience is in me
And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am, huh
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, oh, it's his lyrical content, the song Guilty Conscience
Has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!

Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin'
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
But I'm glad, 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need
For the fire to burn and it's burning, and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am

That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians

Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent, and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign you an autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad, 'cause...

I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

To all my dark niggaz, I'm trying to spark niggaz
I want to shot niggaz, Not to mark niggaz

Prosecuted from making your brain sweat nigga

They fucked up Saddam like my nigga gangsta mind
You don't have to be a Taliban to fill the per tarn
Don't walk the double-you, victims of the rare black and blue

I kicks in the door, waving a automatic
I'm mad as fuck, weaving hard as a asthmatic
Attitudes unpredictable, behaviour is boratic
Could snap at any time, and right now I ain't had it, bitch

Make no mistake about it, your life has just been threatened (echo)

I clock-ed the camera, fuckin up the camera was working the things
Like holding was drama dirtied my name
Mo money, mo drama, my nigga fuck the hype, flash the light
I'm Dub-see connected to the afterlife, see'mon

You look hard, act hard, in the backyard
front yard, lunch card, but the nigga run hard
I run yards, punk guards, nigga so large
If I get caught, nigga no charge

Here come a westcoast gangsta means cagey and creases
Plus a pink slip nigga, you punks is leases
My wife bentley got peanut butter guts like Reece's
Blood peeled niggaz is red like endangered species, fucker

In his age of terror, fear is the killer
One thing remains constant
The Westside motherfucking Connection

You might as well keep it gangsta
They've got a small under surveillance

Bitch you know the side

Fuckin' off cash that I made
Nigga, what's the sense of workin' hard if you never get to play?
I'm hustlin', stayin' out 'til it's dawn
And comin' home at six o'clock in the mornin'
Hand's on my Glock, eyes on the prize
Finger on the trigger when a nigga ride
Shootin' craps, bustin' niggas out the door
Pick my money off the floor, God bless the tre-four
Stuck on full, drunk again
Sippin' on gin with a couple of friends (haha)
Say them Thug Life niggas be like major pimps
Stickin' to the rules was a major sin (biatch)
And if I die, let it be
But when it come for me, bury me a G (sing)

More trouble than the average
Just made twenty five and I'm livin' like a savage
Being a G, it ain't no easy thing
'Cause you could fuck around, get crossed and get stuck in the game
And for the rest of your life you will sit and reminisce
Wonder why it had to end like this
And to the G's you can feel my pain
Until the motherfucker gets born again

You thought it was a game kid, I'm not the nigga for playin' game
I let my buckshots ring when I pull the trigger on my gauge
I'm on the rampage makin' runs for the devil
Ain't nothin' on my mind but gettin' in some trouble
I'm tryna ride no more loves for me hard to figure
Get a nigga, smoke a blunt or it's a jury starts (break yo self)
I gives a fuck nigga stuck outta luck when I bust
Pull me to my death but I'm a G to the enemy (bury me)

I got nothin' to lose so I choose to be a killer
Went from bangin' to slangin', now I'm a dope dealer
All my life paid the price to be the boss
Back to school, broke the rules on gettin' tossed
Poppin' rocks on the block was a past time
Pack a .9 all the time, you wanna test mine?
Don't cry, I die before they play me
From the cradle to the grave, bury me G

Straight thug kickin' it with the homies in the hood
Gettin' drunk, smokin' blunts, my bitch said I'm no good

Never had no time for no bitch instead slangin' rocks
And bustin' caps on you punk ass marks
Fake ass G's, bitch niggas with no heart
I'm stayin' real 'til I'm six feet deep
So when a nigga gone, just bury me a G

Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I

But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No""
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me, man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose

It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing ninety on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who could have saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch, I'm tryna talk
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to

Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me

""What you up to? The cops gon' bust you""
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us, I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple

Never saw so many men slaughtered, and I knew the ho

Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too

He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile

Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids

Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you

And since they regulatin' hoes I rolls with the best side
So check it as my lifetime is tickin'
Comin' up strong lickin' and flippin' chickens
Need cheese in amounts of G's
I gave up sports to slang Key's
But blamed it on my Knees
Make sure I got what I need to make up your order
Everything from baggies, triple beams, to jugs for my water
Like a snitch life's a bitch, a world full of drama
Drug paraphernalia being found by my momma
Trauma brings the sad song yo momma sings
Just served your ass You on your way to killa king nigga
So now I stand, with heat in hand
For my whole life span, 'cause evil lurks the land
Plus I got a packet with this gang-bang jacket
Gotta hold it, keep it loaded devoted, since quoted
Fo sho One-0 got the ups on these prankstas
While my world keep twistin' as a Westside, gangsta
Fo' life nigga

Gangstas make the world go round
Westside is the best side
Gangstas make the world go round
Hittin' vicks for the '96 nigga
Gangstas make the world go round
Westsiiide!
Gangstas make the world go round

Gangstas make the world go round

1040,Shaka ZuluTygaThe Gold Album: 18th Dynasty2015,Tyga,"Looking at myself, I see the man, nigga
I'mma call it like I say it, I'mma call you bitch made nigga
Holding pistols not to entertain niggas
I got held up at the light reaching for my switchblade, nigga
Poppers on a Spanish with the gauge, nigga
If I tell you that the babysitter's dead, don't play, nigga
Reach inside your pockets, dial H, nigga
If you need help with pressure, don't drive this way, nigga
You know I got schizophrenic tendencies
I dream of porn stars and pouring gas on my enemies
If I get a check, I'm not the vet
I'm a dawg ass nigga looking for a hot bitch

Shaka Zulu with the new do with the TEC
This is not a purchase, everyday life shit
I've been praying for your downfall, man
But all I see is bad bitches coming down the hill, damn
Shaka Zulu new do with the TEC
Don't tell anybody that the babysitter's dead
And I heard it from a birdie, it was dead
How'd they bring you back to life? That's a start resurrect

She bowed to her knees, want forgiveness
But all I could think about was coming out of speakers
She a fun girl living on the edge
Poppa ran a hedge fund, all his daughter do is give head
Said he had it up to head and neck
Don't you point the thing at me, it could go off offside your head
Temple to the brain, now he dead
That's a life learned lesson, never stress over bullshit
Wasn't even her why he did it
But he found his wife with his daughter's boyfriend, nigga damn
That's some fucked shit over sex
These bitches overrated and I judge 'em like ""who next?""

Six weeks, had to vacate
Ain't a resident in sight, just a beach, making sex tapes
Sure, say the shit to my face
She gon' get me off, nigga, like bug spray
Bitches all fake and fanatics, causing ruckus with a ratchet
Don't you put that on your loved ones, you are not my level pattern
This is Pacquiao and pack it, peddle faster like a Flintstone
On a roll, full of ashes, we just run you, this the legion
Zulu, it's all gone
Zulu, forever perished
Ten bedrooms in the palace
But your Playboy bunny's ears full of carrots, I told y'all

Who claim the game, we're young living like Meek
Click on the tee, Lord of Rings, you order me
Theatric fairytale's become extinct
Fuck the peace, I put a piece on my neck
'Bout the size of a Complex magazine
I'm not for sale, I bought your dreams
Leonardo DaVinci, the Bentley boost my self-esteem

The watch cost

First things first I pop, slay all the honeys
Ain't it funny? Angel, I got devils wanting money
Seems sacred but get naked
My penetration is all revelations
And my eyes only seeing basic, they foul flagrant
Infatuated with the bracelets, diamond-cut player
You fallacious, not complacent
Competition, I'm your favourite, knock knock
It's me, motherfucker, you're dead wrong
Turning your doorknob, a heartthrob
Never my title but you bitches getting robbed
I rhyme and flip lines so far ahead of my time
My punchlines is lemon lime
I'm sour, nigga, sweeter than pine
I'm God's gift like Christmas time
The money Jewish but it's black on black crimes
They box me in from time to time
For a Rolex, is you willing to die? You willing to die, nigga?
Oh shit, nigga, you a rich nigga?
Does your wrist glitter? How much your car engine?
I can tell you got six figures
Figure you ain't no real nigga
You don't struggle like real niggas
Probably snitch on a real nigga
Just to get you out of bed, nigga
Well let's see, my God is your God
If he got faith in me, go and pull the trigger
And leave it be, nigga
Russian roulette, let's make a bet
100 on black, I'm back with a vengeance, the villain is vicious
Heart of gold is relentless, book of Genesis
Don't eat the apple, but you'd rather live ravish
Street savvy, but not wealthy
Good health, be blessed, tryna reach the heavens
One day as I pray, halo over me
As I lay back, chick on my lap everyday, this God talk

This God talk
This God talk
Let God talk
Stand back lil nigga, let God talk

Tryna follow Christ, but this club light super bright
And they pay me cash every single night
Taking models back to the crib
I know you want my life, you don't want my life
Couldn't handle what they write about you
The Superman of height, you can get 'em high
But how far is you willing to climb for your own shine?
Blowing shine, papers let a nigga vibe, letting God talk
I'm like when summer approach
Niggas thinking they're good, but they're more TO
I'm known coast to coast, you tryna play God
With the devil's robes
It's only one God, boy, you far from close
Been ready, change cars like winter coats
Niggas bubblegum, Winterfresh, in they Easter clothes
No lint on my Easter clothes
Resurrect, the prophet spoke

This God talk
This God talk
Let God talk

And get to clapping 'em and, like, back and forth
Because this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of um, er...

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm an M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you playas worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic
""Hi, Marshall!""
I have a disease, and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet
'Cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You getting knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the pudding, just ask DeShaun Holton

I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming ""Fuck the world"" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck

'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck

I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlasting, I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict

Half animal, half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an afghan

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming ""Fuck the world"" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack

Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack

I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck

Somebody let me out this limousine! I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shooting up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of nagging bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed

Went to gym in 8th grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming ""Fuck the world"" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back

1044,Guilty Conscience,Eminem,"Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life (damn)
And the way things are going (I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store (I gotta take this shit)
But on his way in (I can't take it no more, holmes)
He has a sudden change of heart (Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs (can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (you're right)
Not over this shit (stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

Come on, just come in here for a minute
I don't know
Look, look, look (damn)
Look, it's gonna be alright, alright?
O-okay

Meet Stan, 21 years old (look, give me a kiss)
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy
In an upstairs bedroom (pull your pants down, come on)
Once again, his conscience comes into play (shit)

Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog, then bail

Man, it feels good to be home
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
(What the fuck?) Grady

Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. NWA, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

Been there, done that

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (ah)
It's the return of the ""ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha)

Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who""
""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals, well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (ah)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, ""how can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

Bitch, shut the fuck up, get the fuck outta here
Yo, Dre (What's up?), gimme a funky-ass bassline

Well I'm Eazy-E, I got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches but I got much more
With my super duper group coming out to shoot
Eazy-E, muthafuckers cold knocking the boots
'Cause I'm a (hip-hop) thugster, I used to be a mugster
If you heard (Compton), you think I own a drugstore
Getting stupid because I know how
And if a sucker talks shit, I give him a...

8 ball sipping, the bitches are flipping
Slow down, I hit a dipping, continue my tripping
Hitting my switches, collect from my bitches
The money that I make so I can add to my riches
Fill my stash box and start rubbing my gat
Feeling good as hell because my pockets are fat
A hardcore villian cold roaming the streets
And wit a homie like Dre just supplying the beats

Because I'm a gansta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask ""what was it?""
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy duz it

Funky, fresh Eazy-E
(Kick, kick that shit)
(Where you from fool, Compton, yeah)

Rolling through the hood, cold tearing shit up
Stick my head out the window and I say what's up
To the niggas on the corner cold bumping the box
But you know that's an alibi for slanging the rocks
A dice game started so I said ""what the fuck""
So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit my bitch jocking 24-7
Rolled them muthafuckers, ate 'em up, hit 11

Got another point, I made a ten a fo'
Was taking niggas money and was itching for mo'
Laughing in their faces and said ""you're all making me rich""
Then one punk got jealous, cold slap my bitch
He pulled out his gat, I knew he wouldn't last
So I said to myself, ""homeboy, you better think fast!""
He shot, then I shot
As you can see, I cold smoked his ass (ha ha)

Because I'm a gansta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask ""what was it?""
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy duz it

Muthafuckin' Eazy duz it
(But how does he do it?)
(Eazy duz it do it eazy)
(That's what I'm doing)
(STOP)
(Man whatcha gonna do now?)

Now I'm a break it down just to tell a little story
Straight out the box from the gangsta category
About a sucker, a sucker muthafucker
He's addicted, he's a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house car and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He must of been starving 'cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out!

Now I wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yeah, I went to jail but that wasn't shit
She got to the station about a quarter of nine
Call my bitch to get me out 'cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the ganking zone
All the shit I did for her like keeping her rich
I swear when I get out, I'm gonna kill the bitch!

Well by now you should know it was just my luck
The baliff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye and ""said what's up?""
And said ""let's make a deal, you know I'll do you up""
Now im back on the streets and my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit my Uzi machine
Went to the house and kicked down the door
Unloaded like hell, cold smoked the hoe!

Because I'm a gansta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy duz it

From around the way, born in '73
Harcore B-boy named Eazy-E

Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big G's
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent, til proven guilty
I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up realty
For real G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes
I want it all, Armor All Benz and endless papes

Without the FBI catching feelings

Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back

Two sips from bein alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM

Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up, giving a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty
Ain't that funny? Getting put on to crack money
With all the gun play, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out

The rolleo's and the baguettes
You still fuckin' with them faggots
We turn haters into maggots
Oak on the dash, but no coke on the hash
You broke ass niggas learn to mash, like me
Constantly, put the hustle down
With four or five niggas that's musclebound
Send your head to the taxidermist
Won't be satisfied, till I get my face on a thermos
You got to earn this, you can't take it
Can't fake it, got to live it, or we gots to visit
Who is it, the exquisite, Don Mega
Walkin with my entourage, I think I'm better, makin' chedder
You see me sag in my Jag, with the rag recognize the flag
You better get back, everybody want to do it like me
I got it made, been makin' rap money since the tenth grade

I keeps a firm grip on my shit when in transit
Uncandid, it's the young bandit
Fresh out the trenches, the wood works
City of the Tempeon, where the hoods lurk
In search of the rich blocks, to lick spots, and kick rocks
From shattered glass, down the pig locks
Want tips by the clock
You niggas scramblin' for fouyan
And settle for crumbs and croutons
I'm out for armored bucks and armored trucks, with armed killers
Bitch niggas get swallowed by the armadillos
Ain't no harmin' me, the army full honorary niggas you can't see
So while you pace bitches and Saturn's livin' jenky
I hangs with niggas who got patterns on they hankey
After Ben Frankeys, with the big skullen eyes
You niggas bound and nullified
Sit back and mine stack it multiply

So all hail the honorable

It's to my real ill niggas, heavyweight hitters

Dough getters, fifty ways to make figures

My niggas, that come on the spot to feel sisters

Like they hear real spitters and kids on the zigga-ziggas

When it's ugly, then the club is lovely

Thugs be sipping Hennessey and bubbly

To my comrades that keep it flaming hot

On dangerous blocks, claiming spots

Where the goal is to be one of the top-ranked soldiers

Forty-five holders, one of the high rollers

Get respect in the hood, credit is good

Knock it down lumberjack style, baby, extra wood

Rock it all night long, the bang-a-thon baby

Keep hanging on, we like it with the lights on

Don't have to blow twenty thou' to get to know honey's style

Show her the town, steal her heart, no money down

'Cause this right here is for all of y'all

Rakim and Primo, yo I got what you need bro

You go see a show, smoke an l, mean yo

And deejays play hits with hard bass kicks

And then they display tricks like the matrix

Make the record fly undetected by the naked eye

So just feel the vibe 'cause your ears never lie

Nowadays deejays bags of tricks, graphic

On some behind the back shit, catch it and scratch it

Classic, this kid got his craft mastered

Hands is mad quick like he mix with magic

Spin it back and forth and grab it

And know just where it is, there it is

To my elite peeps with the murderous mystiques

I hit the streets with beats and they critique for weeks

They be like, ""How that kid Ra' reach the peak? ""

Pull out the heat and use my technique to speak

It's dangerous, sit calm and explain to kids

What part of the game this is and foreign languages

They hold Ra's events in different continents

Put my lyrical contents in monuments

In ghetto garments, I rock a towel like a Pharaoh

Mind travel, design style like apparel

My fashions last long as a lifetime

'Cause I can see the future when the God write rhymes

They're mad 'cause I managed to reign so long

Like their chance to make money done came and gone

This is strictly for my listeners on the corners at night

And the sisters that be keeping this right, when I be on the mic

I know you don't want to hear me crying
An I know you don't want to hear me deny
That your satisfaction lies in your illusions
But your delusions are yours an not mine
We take for granted that we know the whole story
We judge a book by it's cover and read what we want
Between selected lines

Don't hail me an don't idolize the ink
Or I've failed in my attentions
Can you find the missing link
Your only validation is in living your own life
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time
So I send this song to the offended
I said what I meant and I've never pretended
As so many others do intending just to please
If I damned your point of view
Could you turn the other cheek

Don't damn me when I speak a piece a mind
'Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
I've been where I have been
An I've seen what I have seen
Put the pen to the paper 'Cause it's all a part of me
Don't damn me
I said don't damn me
I said don't hail me
Ah, don't damn me

Gonna rest my bones, sit for a spell

Has never yet been through now
Was heal the scars that got their start
Inside someone like you now

Back when how long it'd take me
To break the charms that brought me harm
And all that would erase me

I never would or thought I could

I'd want someone to save me

Won't ask for absolution

Still searches for solution

Cures my infatuation
I'm a broken heart, provides the spark

Crying in my head again

Put your hands, put your hands
Inside my face and see that it's just you

And it's making me sad

Thinking back on how things were
And on how we loved so well
I wanted to be the mother of your child
And now it's just farewell
Put your hands in my hands
And come with me
We'll find another end
And my head, and my head
On anyone's shoulder

Wondering if we're really ever gonna get that far
Do you know there's something wrong
'Cause I've felt it all along

I can see your face in the mirrors of my mind
Will you still be there
We're really not so clever as we seem to think we are

We've always got our troubles so we solve them in the bar
As the days go by, we seem to drift apart
If I could only find a way to keep hold of your heart

Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar
Wondering if we're really ever gonna get that far

Sitting in the valley as I watch the sun go down

Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

Is it cloak 'n' dagger
Could it be spring or fall
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist

That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

Want to forgive you for all the things that you do

Sleep beside the pharaohs in the shifting sand

Cut open murmurs and sounds
Becalm hands on the skin
Carry further
Entangled strands all sing

Wild and scheming
Could be my election day

Alternatives all pursued

When others were split in two

As still as a heart grown cold

Within the frequency that night

I walked through the walls

King of his kingdom is surely falling out of range
Stay a while in the present tense
All in good time, you'll find your innocence

Now, as a final fire
Climbs into the single spire
High above the wireless world it hovers

So, as the brightest child
Sinks into the safest arms
Tied against the bomb that hands above us

I could've stayed
If you were mine
If time remained
The reasons would've rhymed

Find me where you don't believe me

Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today

For a leading role in a cage?

He makes his livin' off of the people's taxes

Billy Joe caught up to her the very next day

Maybe even in the state of Tennessee

But I guess I'd better get myself together
'Cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind
Just a note that said, ""I'm sorry"" by your picture
And a song that's weighing heavy on my mind

That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired

The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone

Who called to say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand-me-downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity, please, the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve""

And the rich-relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity

Their small-town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen

To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball

It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game, and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown

They call and say, ""Come dance with me""

At ugly girls like me

Thank you for your time
Ah, you've been so much more than kind
You can keep the dime

1230,Every Picture Tells a Story,Rod Stewart,"Spent some time feeling inferior
Standing in front of my mirror
Combed my hair in a thousand ways
But I came out looking just the same
Daddy said, son, you better see the world
I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave
But remember one thing, don't lose your head
To a woman that'll spend your bread
So I got out, whoo

Paris was a place you could hide away
If you felt you didn't fit in
The French police wouldn't give me no peace
They claimed I was a nasty person
Down along the Left Bank, minding my own, whoo
Was knocked down by a human stampede
Got arrested for inciting a peaceful riot
When all I wanted was a cup of tea
I was accused, whoo

I moved on

Down in Rome, I wasn't getting enough
Of the things that keep a young man alive
My body stunk, but I kept my funk, whoo
At a time when I was right outta luck
Getting desperate, indeed I was, yeah
Looking like a tourist attraction
Oh my dear, I better get out of here
For the Vatican don't give no sanction
I wasn't ready for that, no, no

I moved right out east, yeah

Listen, on the Peeking ferry, I was feelin merry
Sailing on my way back here
I fell in love with a slit-eyed lady
By the light of an eastern moon
Shanghai Lil never used the pill
She claimed that it just ain't natural
She took me up on deck and bit my neck
Oh, people, I was glad I found her
Oh, yes I was glad I found her, woo-hoo

Wait a minute
I firmly believed that I
Didn't need anyone but me
I sincerely thought I was so complete
Look how wrong you can be

The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe
They wouldn't give you the time of day
But the slit-eyed lady knocked me off my feet
God, I was glad I found her
And if they had the words I could tell to you
To help you on the way down the road
I couldn't quote you no Dickens, Shelley or Keats
'Cause it's all been said before
Make the best out of the bad, just laugh it off, ha
You didn't have to come here anyway

1235,Ode to Billie Joe,Bobbie Gentry,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And mama hollered out the back door, y'all, remember to wipe your feet
And then she said, I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today, Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And papa said to mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas
Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow
And mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And mama said to me, child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning, and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge

A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round; papa caught it, and he died last spring
And now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",LyricFind

And it's taken you so long

Just one more year and then you'd be happy

He opens the door, he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen
And you talk about anything

He's got this dream about buying some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one-night stands
And then he'll settle down
In some quiet little town
And forget about ev'rything

But they don't tell it all
Not how lovers cry out
Just like they're dying

In time, somewhere

Someday, some good wind
May blow her back to me
Some night I may hear
Her like she used to be

1320,Lady in Black,Uriah Heep,"She came to me one morning
One lonely Sunday morning
Her long hair flowing
In the midwinter wind.

I know not how she found me
For in darkness I was walking
And destruction lay around me
From a fight I could not win

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

She asked me name my foe then
I said the need within some men
To fight and kill their brothers
Without thought of love or God

And I begged her, give me horses
To trample down my enemies
So eager was my passion
To devour this waste of life

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

But she wouldn't think of battle that
Reduces men to animals
So easy to begin
And yet impossible to end

For she's the mother of all men
Who counselled me so wisely then
I feared to walk alone again
And asked if she would stay

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

Oh, lady, lend your hand outright
And let me rest here at your side
""Have faith and trust in peace"", she said
And filled my heart with life

There is no strength in numbers
Have no such misconception
But when you need me
Be assured, I won't be far away

Ah, ah-ah, a-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

Thus, having spoke, she turned away
And though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw
Her black coat disappear

My labour is no easier
But now I know I'm not alone
I'll find new heart each time
I think upon that windy day

And if one day she comes to you
Drink deeply from her words so wise
Take courage from her as your prize
And say hello from me

1345,American Pie,Don McLean,"Long long time ago, I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die""
This will be the day that I die

Did you write the Book of Love?
And do you have faith in God above?
If the Bible tells you so
Do you believe in rock 'n' roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Then I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singing bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die""
This will be the day that I die

Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the King and Queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the King was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lenin read a book of Marx
The Quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singing, bye-bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die""
This will be the day that I die

Helter skelter in the summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass, the players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singing bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singing, ""This'll be the day that I die""
This will be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singing bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singing, ""This'll be the day that I die""
This will be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

And they were singing bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die""
This will be the day that I die

Catch the mystery, catch the drift

Love and life are deep
Maybe as his skies are wide

And the space he invades, he gets by on you

His mind is not for rent
To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent
He knows changes aren't permanent
But change is

What you say about his company is
What you say about society
Catch the witness, catch the wit
Catch the spirit, catch the spit

The world is, the world is

Maybe as his eyes are wide

Right on to the friction of the day

A planet of playthings, we dance on the strings of powers we cannot perceive

If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill
I will choose a path that's clear, I will choose Freewill

There are those who think that they were dealt a losing hand
The cards were stacked against them they weren't born in Lotus Land

All preordained, a prisoner in chains, a victim of venomous fate
Kicked in the face, you can pray for a place, in heaven's unearthly estate

You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice
If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill
I will choose a path that's clear, I will choose Freewill

Each of us, a cell of awareness, imperfect and incomplete
Genetic blends with uncertain ends on a fortune hunt that's far too fleet

And when the morning light comes streaming in
I'll get up and do it again, Amen
Say it again, Amen

I want to know what became of the changes
We waited for love to bring
Were they only the fitful dreams
Of some greater awakening?

I've been aware of the time going by
They say, in the end, it's the wink of an eye
When the morning light comes streaming in
You'll get up and do it again, Amen

Caught between the longing for love
And the struggle for the legal tender
Where the sirens sing and the church bells ring
And the junk man pounds his fender
Where the veterans dream of the fight
Fast asleep at the traffic light
And the children solemnly wait
For the ice cream vendor

Out into the cool of the evening
Strolls the pretender
He knows that all his hopes and dreams
Begin and end there

ah, the lovers as they run through the night
(Leaving nothing) leaving nothing but to choose off and fight
And tear at the world with all their might
While the ships bearing their dreams
Sail out of sight

I'm gonna find myself a girl
Who can show me what laughter means
And we'll fill in the missing colors
In each other's paint-by-number dreams

And then we'll put our dark glasses on
And we'll make love until our strength is gone
And when the morning light comes streaming in
We'll get up and do it again
Get it up again

I'm gonna be a happy idiot
And struggle for the legal tender
Where the ads take aim and lay their claim
To the heart and the soul of the spender
And believe in whatever may lie
In those things that money can buy
Where true love could have been a contender

Are you there? Say a prayer for the pretender

I messed around with all the rules
Apologised then realised
I'm not different after all

Me and the boys thought we had it sussed
Valentinos all of us
My dad said we looked ridiculous
But boy, we broke some hearts

In and out of jobs, running free
Waging war with society
Dumb blank faces stare back at me
But nothing ever changed

Promises made in the heat of the night
Creeping home before it got too light
I wasted all that precious time
And blamed it on the wine

I was only joking my dear (my dear)
Looking for a way to hide my fear (my fear)
What kind of fool was I? (Was I)
I could never win (never win)

Never found a compromise
Collected lovers like butterflies
Illusions of that grand first prize
Are slowly wearing thin

Susie, baby, you were good to me
Giving love unselfishly
But you took it all too seriously
I guess it had to end

I was only joking my dear (my dear)
Looking for a way to hide my fear (my fear)
What kind of fool was I? (Was I)
I could never win (never win)

Yeah baby, whoa

Now you ask me if I'm sincere
That's the question that I always fear
Vers e seven is never clear
But I'll tell you what you wanna hear

I try to give you all you want
But giving love is not my strongest point
If that's the case it's pointless going on
I'd rather be alone

'Cause what I'm doing must be wrong
Pouring my heart out in a song
Owning up for prosperity
For the whole damn world to see

There's something back here that you left behind
Oh time passages

Don't know why you should feel
That there's something to learn
It's just a game that you play

Well the picture is changing

They're laughing at something
And the music's loud
A girl comes towards you

We lived happily forever

On the pot of gold

For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave

1443,YYZ,Rush,"There is unrest in the forest
There is trouble with the trees
For the maples want more sunlight
And the oaks ignore their pleas

The trouble with the maples
And they're quite convinced they're right
They say the oaks are just too lofty
And they grab up all the light
But the oaks can't help their feelings
If they like the way they're made
And they wonder why the maples
Can't be happy in their shade

There is trouble in the forest
And the creatures all have fled
As the maples scream, oppression!
And the oaks just shake their heads

So, the maples formed a union
And demanded equal rights
These oaks are just too greedy
We will make them give us light
Now there's no more oak oppression
For they passed a noble law
And the trees are all kept equal
By hatchet, axe, and saw",Musixmatch

There's an old man sittin' next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
But there's some place that he'd rather be

""Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Sing us the song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while

And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say man what are you doin' here?

I wasn't even there

A son was born to me
Mama held his hand
Saying, ""Someday you'll understand""

Well, I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast, you better learn it young

Vanishing memories of things that were said
They can't try to hurt me now

But a shot in the dark, one step away from you
A shot in the dark, always creeping up on you

Taught by the powers that preach over me
I can hear their empty reason
I wouldn't listen I learnt how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason

But just like the wounded and when it's too late
They'll remember they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

A shot in the dark not a thing that you can do
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you

In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
The darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small

Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy
Can't remember when
I last saw you laughing
This world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just call me up
'Cause I will always be there

And I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you

So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
I see your true colors
Shining through (true colors)

And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show

And the people that you knew at Elaine's
And the story of your latest success
Kept 'em so entertained

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May Queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
And there's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder

Oh, whoa

Your head is humming and it won't go
In case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him

Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all, yeah
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to heaven",Musixmatch

Tribute.
Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,
We was hitchhiking down a long and lonesome road.
All of a sudden,
There shined a shiny demon,
In the middle of the road,
And he said!

Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your souls...
Well me and Kyle,
We looked at each other,
And we each said,
Okay.

And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
Just so happened to be
The best song in the world,
It was the best song in the world.

Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one makes two, two and one makes three,
It was destiny.
Once every hundred thousand years or so
When the sun doth shine
And the moon doth glow and the grass doth grow.

Needless to say,
The beast was stunned.
Whip-crack went his whippy tail,
And the beast was done.
He asked us,
Be you angels?
And we said nay,
We are but men,
Rock!

Ah, ah, ah, oh, wo, a-yo!

This is not the greatest song in the world, no.
This is just a tribute!
Couldn't remember the greatest song in the world, yeah - no!
This is a tribute!
To the greatest song in the world,
Alright!
It was the greatest song in the world,
Alright!
This is the greatest motherfuckin' song, the greatest song in the world oh!

And the peculiar thing is this my friends,
The song we sang on that fateful night,
It didn't actually sound anything like this song!

This is just a tribute!
You gotta believe me,
And I wish you were there,
Just a matter of opinion.
Ah, ah, oh!

Gotta love him,
I'm so surprised to find ya can't stop him!

Right through the center of town and
No one blinks an eye
And I look up to the sky for the path of a lighting bolt

Met her as the angels parted for her
But she only brought me torture
But that's what happens
When it's you who's standing in the path of a lightning bolt

Everyone I see just wants to walk with gritted teeth
But I just stand by and I wait my time
They say you gotta tow the line they want the water not the wine
But when I see the signs I jump on that lightning bolt

And chances, people tell you not to take chances
When they tell you there aren't any answers
And I was starting to agree
But I awoke suddenly in the path of a lightning bolt

Fortune, people talking all about fortune
Do you make it or does it just call you
In the blinking of an eye
Just another passerby in the path of a lightning bolt

Everyone I see just wants to walk with gritted teeth
But I just stand by and I wait my time
They say you gotta tow the line they want the water not the wine

Your black cards can make you money so you hide them when you're able
In the land of milk and honey, you must put them on the table

Enough for me to love
Enough to love

She was just a wish
She was just a wish

Stacy Beadle, PJ and my man L.G
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
The character is of men, never ever of mice
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice
It has to do with lots of loving and it ain't nothing nice

Relax yourself girl, please settle down (it ain't nothing nice)
Relax yourself girl, please settle down (it ain't nothing nice)
Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself girl, please settle down

2986,Marvin Gaye,Charlie Puth,"Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healin' that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

We got this king-size to ourselves
Don't have to share with no one else
Don't keep your secrets to yourself
It's Kama Sutra show and tell, yeah

Whoa, there's lovin' in your eyes that pulls me closer
(Oh, it pulls me closer)
It's so subtle (It's so subtle), I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
But I love to be in trouble with you

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

You've got to give it up to me
I'm screaming, ""Mercy, mercy, please!""
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

And when you leave me all alone
I'm like a stray without a home
I'm like a dog without a bone
I just want you for my own

I got to have you, babe

Whoa, there's lovin' in your eyes that pulls me closer

It's so subtle (It's so subtle), I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
But I'd rather be in trouble with you

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

Oh, baby, I got that healing that you want, yeah
Like they say it in the songs
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on, babe

You've got to give it up to me
I'm screaming, ""Mercy, mercy, please!""
Just like they say it in the song

Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on, oh",Musixmatch
